"To anyone reading this questioning whether they should take Stat 435 with Stefan - do it. It will be the best decision of your undergrad. Easily my favourite professor Ive had, clear lectures, group work that is applicable to real life statistics, etc. Take home midterm, open book final. Do your work, pay attention, easy 80+. TAKE THIS CLASS.",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"instructions are unclear, too many workloads. He made us hand in a report every week which require a lot of investigaions and time. However, his instructions are unclear, usually dun know what to do.",1.5,4.0, Mandatory,
"Good prof. A bit mundane but its a stat course so kinda of expected. Midterms are hard but the final made up for it. He cares about his students even though he doesn't show it. The course material looks boring but once you study it bit further, you'll enjoy the material.",4.0,3.0,,
"Great notes, lots of examples. Fair tests and final. A nice guy",5.0,1.0,,
"His notes are very helpful and organized. He is really good at explaining and teaching. Very approachable too. He would provide past tests and assignments for references. He also reviews tests. Also, in the beginning of each class, he would do a quick review to help students to keep on track of the materials.",5.0,3.0,,
Really knowledgeable. Very helpful to students in and out of class. Really nice and a pleasure to have as a prof!,4.5,2.0,,
"The worse prof I ever had. He did not care one bit, taught from slides that made no sense and couldn't even solve the proofs himself. Avoid at all costs!",1.0,5.0,,
Dry but effective.  Friendly and approachable demeanor.,4.0,3.0,,
A very very annoying course. But he did his level best to make it interesting. Enthusiastic about the topic and gives good notes. If you have to take the course (and it's mandatory) take it with him.,5.0,2.0,,
soso..but his note is really good!! but no more examples about cars plz!!!,3.0,3.0,,
"Pretty good. Could be more energetic/funny but comparing to most, a very good prof",4.0,2.0,,
Pretty good explanations especially considering the course materials.  Excellent notes!,4.5,2.0,,

Pretty good oral presentation and good explanations for questions,4.0,3.0, Mandatory,
good course notes,4.0,4.0,,
"His lectures are fun to attend to since its as if he's story telling. His tests are essay writing but he will tell you about whats going to be on it as early as week #2. The key points to passing his class is to sit around the front row, take notes during his lecture and make sure they're neat AND most importantly, don't miss any lectures or labs!",4.0,4.0,,
One of the hardest markers I have even seen in my life.,3.0,5.0,,
"I love this guy! He's just plain magic!! He is a good teacher. His lectures are really good. The way he teaches about the various protocols is interesting and easy to remember. Ian is a great teacher, he really knows his stuff. If you walk into his class ready to learn and write a lot, you'll do really well.  Ian Allison is an great teacher.",4.5,1.0,,
"Expect google to be your professor. No additional material other then lectures. sure his lectures are different, and makes you laugh at times. but if you have difficulty following the lecture, dont expect any additional help. Lab classes are also fairly useless.",1.5,5.0,,
"Hands down the best lecturer I've ever had.  Makes boring and obsolete topics interesting.  He's informal and it makes it easier to relate to him.  He's a super hard marker and his tests are killer.  TAKE NOTES.  Write down EVERYTHING he says, as the tests are directly based on the lectures.  Essay format, one mark per paragraph.",4.5,5.0,,
"Good teacher, knows his stuff. expects a lot from students come midterm time. expect to write 10 essays in less than 2 hours. No one finishes his midterm. Cool guy, just a hard marker and hard on students. get on his good side and he'll get on yours.",4.5,4.0,,
"Ian is a great teacher, he really knows his stuff. If you walk into his class ready to learn and write a lot, you'll do really well. Study at least a week in advance for both the midterm and the exam as you'll be writing about 45 paragraphs for each. Tests are more of memorization than knowledge, but if you know it, you'll remember it. He's awesome",4.5,5.0,,
"Awesome, especially when it's steak day!",5.0,5.0,,
"Best prof. And by best I mean he is the hardest marking dude around. Despite this, I managed to pass when 75% didn't. He decided to give us an ""easy"" final in order to get his rating up here on this site while he was away on vacation. I guess he hoped people would think he changed his ways but...he definitely won't. Cheers Ian!",3.5,5.0,,
"The Midterm and Final Exam are both given in essay/question format. Each mark is basically one paragraph on what is lectured weekly. You will need to other students and friends for notes and/or do research on your own. Put in WORK. Do not feel bad if you fail the first time. One of the harder courses in the program, but you will come out a WINNER.",4.0,5.0,,
"Thank you for giving me ""B+"" after the first ""F"" I got from you. Thanks Ian ;)",3.0,4.0,,
I love this guy.  He's the best.  Although he doesn't know whats going he's so cute.,1.0,5.0,,
"This guy is always in a different planet.  Perhaps instead of teaching us all he thinks or dreams about his johnny walker.  Way to go, professor.  See you in the next class after all the Fs you gave me.  Thanks i appreciate it.  See ya soon.",5.0,1.0,,
"Wants you to memorize information and write essays for your exams. Did not help during labs and even though this is a very important course, you do not learn anything if taking it with this teacher. In my opinion he came **** to every lab class ... very unprofessional.",3.0,4.0,,
"He is a good teacher. His lectures are really good. The way he teaches about the various protocols is interesting and easy to remember. However you need to put hard work else you will fail this course, because his expectation is very high. He is not much helpful in labs. However if you put your effort and learn it you will understand.",3.5,5.0,,
"In the lab his useless. Lectures he know everything no slides.He makes his tests impossible to remember. His older the then the protocols he teaches. Somewhat funny. ""When you guys go to party talk about data com stuff the girls will love you.""  Tests are way to difficult to remember everything he wants. He needs to cut back on the drinking tho.",3.0,5.0,,
"Hard classes, nice prof. Very charismatic and funny. Has a very peculiar way to teach. Usually on his breaks u can spot him at the bar (... Hill) at York Lanes taking beers with Scott.",4.5,5.0,,
"Well after a stop at the blueberry hill and a smoke he will always fill the class with excitement, walking around the class to each student this guy will keep you on your feet. He knows his stuff, the only teacher i have had at Seneca that teaches 100% true without aid, and for people who think you can skip, his basement is already full of scotch!!",3.5,1.0,,
"He is an idol for ""old school"". I felt like an illiterate during his lectures. Never seen a professor giving a lecture completely from his head without using any visual aid and without a single mistake in technical description. No wonder all other profs tell you go to him for datacom questions.",4.5,4.0,,
Ian Allison will kick your ass! You will walk into his class soft and leave carved out of wood... ask him to teach you assembly if you're breezing through Datacom.,5.0,5.0,,
"He is my favorite Seneca professor. I don't attend the classes because they are asynchronous, but I watched all of his videos to prepare for quizzes, examinations, and labs. Taking notes of the commands will help you achieve a high grade. He also has a great voice and explains the complex material in an easy to comprehend manner.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
hard marking,1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory,
"Made learning Linux fun. Interesting lectures, knows his stuff. Quizzes were a bit tricky but if you studied the material it wasn't a problem. Usually responded to emails within a day.",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"He knows how to teach, his material is well organized into video sections step by step, he puts emphasis on clear communication and uses calendar (halelluja!) Seneca should just let him teach 100% online as his way of online teaching is exemplary and really well executed. Lecture heavy but If you have a bad grade, not his fault. Really nice voice.",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"When I see reviews crying about difficulty, it's not Brian's fault. He gives THE BEST online lectures I've seen in Seneca. He also covers the material with his step-by-step videos for each part of the course. He is enormously approachable and kind but mutual respect has to be shown. Brian will teach you SO MUCH but don't expect the grade for free",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
Just take him very easy grader. If you put a little effort and attend classes or even watch recorded classes syou would pass you just need a little practice with commands. Tests are very easy and interesting. He is the best prof for this course.,5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Really great professor, very dedicated. Patiently answers any questions anybody has. Yes, there are a lot of quizzes, but if you sit through his classes or go through his course videos, it won't be too difficult. He also goes through the answers after each quiz - super helpful, not many professors do that. I'd definitely take him again.",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
One of the best professor i had. Learn a lot from him!,5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Quizzes are hard and every things are matter.,1.0,2.0, Not Mandatory,
"Pretty Straight Foward guy, lots of quizzes, tests, and assignments, like probably 2-3 quizzes a week, but normally everything is explained in slides, couldn't really keep up with his lectures, would zone out from time to time, makes the course time consuming, wouldn't really take again",2.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
Easy to understand and great at explaining things.,5.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"I don't understand the policy that If u fail the final test although that u did perfectly in everything else, u get an F!!!!",2.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
"It was a great course overall and the professor made Linux look easy rather than making students cram it, practical knowledge was more emphasized.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Brian Gray is great. He knows the material very well, he has a wonderful voice and you enjoy listening to his lectures.",5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Knows the material, but is boring to listen to (may be the material's fault). Marks are all subjective, there's no part marks. Doesn't always read his emails properly.",3.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Brian Gray is a good lecturer. If you ask question he explains. However, he is rude. He directly does not say bad word to anyone, but his tone of voice prevents you from asking your question.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Won't make an effort to show up if he doesn't need to be there for testing. Even if it does happen to be test day, flip a coin if class is cancelled. Even when he is teaching the lecture it is extremely barebones. I think I learned nothing from his course except how to read lab instructions. Super easy course.",1.0,2.0, Mandatory, No
He is one of the best professors in Seneca for any Linux courses I must say. He evaluates our exam paper in a way to bring perfection in our learning. I really appreciate his feedback.,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
He is horrible,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"Before him I was taking at least 3 online courses, but Brian's explanation was the best. You have to put some effort into Assignments and do them again and again and you'll definitely pass.",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"I had him for first year, and I thought he was a decent lecturer. But as the years went by, I realized that he did not prepare me well. There's a difference between getting through a course, and then getting you ready for the next course. I wish he would have taught a deeper understanding of the concepts versus making everything easy.",2.0,2.0, Mandatory, No
"Ian is a really nice guy. But he only touches the surface of each concept. When you ask for more details, he doesn't know them. That's good for those who just want to pass the course, since he teaches easy and has great lectures. He tries to avoid tougher questions and does not follow up, but expects you to read up on it yourself.",2.0,3.0,, No
Really amazing prof. Didn't like the course too much but he was great.,5.0,3.0,, Yes
"Ian is just great! The best professor I've had. Very clear, organized and engaging.",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory,
"What I like most about Vanderburgh is that he explains everything very clearly while also keeping the interest of students who know the material. He's funny, very intelligent and makes it a joy to be in class. Also, even though he's a busy guy, he's always helpful if you ask.  Absolutely the best prof I have.",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory,
One of my favourite prof!,5.0,1.0,,
"He was our substitute teacher for a couple of math137 lectures, and he was awesome, as always. I actually chose to come to UW partially because of him! I was in a week long math seminar at uw during grade 12 and luckily had him as our lecturer. That's how good he is!!",5.0,2.0,,
"The side-effect of having Ian as a first-year course prof is that I am now forever comparing other profs to him and none is even remotely comparable (well, perhaps with the exception of Joe West).  Also, he seems to be an all-around accomplished guy.  Hell, he plays piano for our school choir and runs marathon annually, what else can he NOT do?",5.0,3.0,,
"Just awesome, period!",5.0,3.0,,
He is one of the best profs in u of w I think. I have taken math 135 and Pmath 340 with him. His class was very interesting and not very hard to follow. I strongly suggest him to be your first Math 135 prof if you are a new math students in u of w.,5.0,3.0,,
BEST PROF EVER!!!,5.0,1.0,,
One of a kind!,5.0,1.0,,
"Absolutely amazing professor. If you can take any course with him, DO IT.",5.0,2.0,,
"What else can I say?  Read all his ""fans'"" comments, they're all true. :)  GO TO HIS CLASS!!!!  I was inspired to go to his 8:30am class just to hear lecture!! Teaches BETTER than the textbook--no need to buy course material as long as you attend all his lectures! He's SO friendly, and will know your name--such a young course coordinator!(only 30!)",5.0,2.0,,
"Ian is my GOD!! Not going to his classes should definitely be a crime! He was so nice and helpful. When our class clapped when he told us he was engaged he blushed, funniest thing ever. I think we should work on cloning Ian multiple times to teach all math classes!!",5.0,3.0,,
"Ian was by far the best professor I had this semester.  He is extremely knowledgeable, really teaches the material well, and he's pretty funny at times.  I actually really enjoyed the class just because of how great of a prof Ian was.  I would definitely recommend his classes",5.0,2.0,,
his class is the only class i even consider going to at 8:30 in the morning... although i still fail at waking up....,5.0,2.0,,
"Everyone was saying how great of a prof. he was but I didn't know until I took this class... and yeah, definitely one of the best!",5.0,3.0,,
"Ian is absolutely wonderful!  He's really patient with questions... if you have the slightest chance to take his class, take it!  It's well worth the extra work!",5.0,3.0,,
"The only prof Ive had who made the class so interesting, I would have rather gone to class than teach it to myself! Amazing people skills.",5.0,2.0,,
"Amazing teacher, I would recommend him.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I took his fitness and conditioning class completely frightened of being yelled at and such, but it was completely the opposite! Les is such a kind professor, slightly traditional, but super motivating. He helps create a ""running culture"" for the entire class and I've really enjoyed my time in his class. It's actually my favourite.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Les is a relatable prof who you can speak to at any time about anything. He challenges you in your schooling, but also in your daily life. He's rememberable and you always take something away from his class each day.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Les is a unique professor that veers away from traditional textbook learning and immerses his students with engaging discussion. His views on holistic wellness are a great example to live your life by. Only con is that the final exam is worth a ton on textbook material that we hardly covered in class. He needs to tie up the evaluation a bit.,5.0,3.0,,
"Les is honestly the most motivational man I've  ever had the pleasure of meeting. He is tough but he pushes you to be your best. In the running class he is supportive and fair and basis marks off of your attitude. In his lecture, if you put in the work Les makes sure you are rewarded. Great teacher! Highly recommended!!!",5.0,3.0, Mandatory,
"so helpful, especially for international students. simply, the best.",5.0,1.0,,
"learning is done in Les's class not through rote memorization or boring lectures but through experience, thought provoking excersise and real life down to earth examples that Les brings in from all areas. Amazing prof whose classes will change you for the better!",5.0,2.0,,
"Great prof! Very Passionate, enthusiastic, motivated, outgoing and experienced. He knows what he's talking about. Grades are determined based on your performance, attitude and effort. Highly recommended !",5.0,2.0,,
"No structure. Every class i've taken with Les has been a struggle to get through.  All I had in my notes from lectures were his favorite quotes he told us to write down. Needs to TEACH, not PREACH.  Every semester during the last week of class he hits us with 15 chapters we didn't cover which are on the exam.  Went to 30% of classes and got an A",1.5,1.0,,
"This man has a giant heart, he is very passionate about what he does. Good teacher, makes me feel like a bad person!",3.5,1.0,,
"His assignments were good an insightful, but they were worth pretty much nothing. The final exam was worth a whopping 40% and had absolutely nothing to do with what he said in class. The final is only from the textbook - and it is a very tough and long exam. You pretty much have to memorize every chapter in order to do well.",1.5,4.0,,
"EXCELLENT teacher. He knows his material, and is always pure and good to all his students. I admire all his beliefs and practices. He is a healthy man, and inspiring to all students. I would definelty recommend taking one of his classes, as you will find out for yourself how great of a person he is. There is not many people like him, and I love him",5.0,3.0,,
the most enriching man i know whos passionate and creates a culture of wellness in everyone he meets.  gets to know all of his students individually and is a strong inspiration to all the teams in the athletics department.  love the man!,4.0,4.0,,
"just an amazin person...makes u think twice about what u throw into ur body thurs nights at the foundary, his tests arent alot on lecture.but this is by far the best class ive ever taken...cant wait to take another one:D",4.0,1.0,,
3rd class now with Les.  Such a class act!  Such a unique and passionate individual.  I think he should rule the world.,4.5,2.0,,
"Awesome teacher, so passionate about what he teaches. Makes me want to be a healthier, better person. I would recommend any class with Les",4.0,3.0,,
"Les is the reason why I am a healthy indavudual and not diabetic and 400 pounds. He changed my life with his passion towards health and wellness. I own my life to this man and he is the reason why I am going to be a teacher to do the same for other students. Take any of his classes, you will never, ever, regret it.",5.0,4.0,,
"Les is full of passionate energy and has a uncanny nack for getting his students to really become involved in the world of Physical Education. My only problem with Les is, he is very unclear in his teaching style. I recommend that you enroll in his running class, you will not regret it!",3.5,3.0,,
An Inspiring Teacher! Les is one in a million.,5.0,3.0,,
Les is a really nice guy and was a nice change to have from all the other ED courses,4.0,2.0,,
"Best teacher I ever met. Patient, kind, encouraging till I caught up, then inspiring, w/high expectations. Brought out all our different strengths, while always helping us improve. Amazing readings every class.Studying w/Tim was a high point of my life.The ribs creak & strain with the love. & poems come. Class was a great joy to me.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Professor Seibles is a true gem. I took an intro Creative Writing class just for kicks with him in 2001, and graduated with a degree in English in 2004. That was definitely not my plan when I started at ODU. I specifically sought out and took every class I could with him - 4 or 5. I follow him to this day, he is the Poet Laureate of Virginia!",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I know everyone thinks Siebels is some kind of poetry God,but as an older student, while an easy teacher, I found him to be a narcissistreads too much of his own stuff, smiles like a phony and knows hes good looking. Do the readings, come to class,participate, and youll get an A.",2.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Professor Seibles is a very well respected professor. I enjoyed taking his 112 ENG class! He made the class very interesting by reciting various poems, some that he wrote. Also, he encourages participation at all times, it essential to your grade! Participation was fun and I enjoyed listening to the other students point of views as well. Read!",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
Professor Seibles is an amazing professor a published poet and awesome teacher. He gets down to our level he understands were students love to share his poem with the class no tests just weekly reading which is fairly easy. Had three assignments very forgiving lets you rewrite mid term. Gives great feedback and enjoyable class I highly recommend.,5.0,1.0, Mandatory, Yes
Professor Seibles is one of my favorite professors at ODU. He emphasizes that he wants you to pass his class with an A. He just wants you to participate in the class discussions and really read and keep an open mind when reading. He understands that not everyone is an English major and reads and writes like one. He is a very conscientious grader.,5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
It's true when they say his class is like a black history class. He really just wants you to think for yourself. Overall a good class,4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Seibles was actually my favorite professor I've had so far at Old Dominion. The class requires a lot of reading from a giant book with small text but as long as you read you should be okay.  There are quite a few short papers and quizzes but like I said, if you keep up with the reading your grade should reflect that. He's very big on participation and he likes to hear the ideas of everyone in class. He definitely tries to keep and open mind and seeks to understand the ideas of others. I would recommend taking Seibles over some of the other English professors I've come across so far.",3.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Seibles is amazing. He is a wonderful poet and he wants his students to grow and be successful. He is also very humorous and has such a kind soul. I wish I could take every literature class with him. MAKE SURE you do the readings weekly though because class discussion is a big chunk of your grade & there are pop quizzes (quizzes are very easy).,5.0,1.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Professor Seibles is fantastic. He is an amazing poet and really helps you to improve your writing skills. He knows we are students, so he doesn't expect perfection, but he does expect a basic knowledge of proper punctuation and sentence structure (you are in college after all). I highly recommend him if you are interested in being a writer!",5.0,1.0, Mandatory,
"Seibles is fantastic.  He understands rhythm and words like no other professor can explain.  The way he speaks helped me visualize patterns and the effects of word and line length.  Where other professors are technical, Seibles knows how to get to the primal understanding of language.",5.0,1.0, Mandatory,
"Tim is the best! He is an awesome teacher, who keeps his students interest at every turn. He is wonderful! He is hot.",5.0,2.0,,
He can toss his can of chili around with the best of them,4.5,4.0,,
"Seibles is the poetry man! If you enjoy a teacher with real passion for the subject and creative assignments then take him. He loves to compare poetry to jazz and will make a class go outside to write. Anyone who says a 50 plus year old man can't be sexy obviously has not heard him out-loud. His voice can melt hearts (cliche, I know).",4.5,1.0,,
Tim is awesome! I would not be where I am today if it were not for his wonderful teaching and expertise.,5.0,2.0,,
"If you are a Creative Writing Major at ODU, you must run not walk and take Professor Seibles class. He is a well established mentor to all future poets at ODU and an overall great guy. The class is inspiring and if you're lucky to have a great group of classmates. Unforgettable.",5.0,2.0,,
"Great teacher. His main point to the class was for you to open your world to other people and ideas. He's a pretty liberal guy, so if you swing the other way, you might not enjoy the class so much. Picks readings from a wide variety of authors and poets. Class was very enjoyable for myself, I was actually sad to have to miss a few while sick.",4.5,3.0,,
"great teacher, very knowledgeable. classes were rather boring though.",4.0,3.0,,
"Just a note--Seibles is in his 50s so I don't know about those hot peppers! He has great style--he is engaging and encouraging, and his expressiveness really helps move you along in your own creativity. Though I like the man, I did not enjoy the course because for a creative writing class it was entirely too book-heavy! Oral quizzes daily, yuck!",4.0,3.0,,
"Very focused on himself and his own ideas, and not enough time given at all to the texts and alternate readings of them. Friendly and entertaining, but I hated going to class--felt like a waste of time.",3.0,1.0,,
"She was very nice, however you only have 2 or 3 grades for the class which made it stressful.",2.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
"I loved this class, I was a freshman here at ODU so this class was one of my first ever college classes! Prof. is very caring about her students and very kind! You can tell she is very passionate about what she does and it makes class fun. If you do not like to read, do not take her. You will do a lot of reading, but the readings are interesting!!!",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I took this class to complete a gen ed requirement this semester. She grades too hard, and I didn't get any of the grades I deserved. I put in so much work and didn't get the outcome I wanted. The lectures are boring and I would never even think about taking this class again.",1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
Nothing,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"For a night class in the dead of winter, this professor was even colder. rarely smiled & a little insulting in her feedback. Worst part of my entire master's program experience. I determined that if I ever decided to teach, I would be the opposite of this professor - encouraging, engaging and someone who gets you excited about the material",1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"Pretentious and cold. The material for her classes is the same for every course she teaches, which is bad enough, but her husband teaches the exact same material as well.",1.0,2.0,, No
"I never met a teacher so unwilling to listen. On a number of occasions she specifically objected to an older learner for having a viewpoint, especially a viewpoint against her own. Complained about her workload and graded off by personality instead of actual knowledge. She seriously needs to stop thinking she's unprejudiced.",1.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, No
This was the worst class I've taken at ODU. She loves the material but if you don't you will struggle with it. She is a harsh grader and gives very little clarification on why you received the grade you did. There are not many graded assignments in the course and so the Final paper ends up being 50% of the grade!,1.0,3.0, Mandatory, No
"The world of cultural and literary theory cannot be squeezed into one semester.  Before taking this class, I wish I had read the text book like 5 times.  There are so many abstract concepts.  Professor Mourao was okay, but I think her expectations were a little high.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory,
"superb professor! Her teaching style compliments all texts studied in class, as historical background figures largely into time period consideration and novel publication. She is kind, brilliant, and, above all, really wants her students to understand the material and succeed. One of the best profs I've ever had the pleasure of encountering!",5.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"Good teacher, good person. Very funny. NEED TEXTBOOK, buy on Amazon. If you do the readings, you should be fine. There is a quiz every day before class. The class was pretty hard, not much work, a lot of listening. She is a nice person and a good teacher though, but I might not take her again. Disliked the class but I like her.",5.0,4.0,,
"Professor Mourao loves British literature which is cool, but it means she only lectures. She is very kind and understanding, but not necessarily helpful. Quiz every class and the tests are meant to test your understanding of a few of the dozens of concepts she brings up in class. The point is, this class is great but difficult to do well in.",3.5,4.0,,
"Prof. Mourao is a brilliant woman who loves what she teaches. Unfortunately, she wants everyone else to love it too, and if you don't, sucks to be you.  Quiz almost every class, so if you want to pass, READ.",2.0,3.0,,
"Very intelligent. Rather rough, but the class is crit. theory so that's expected. A fair yet almost tough grader. You can't BS her. My advice is attend if not all, most classes, the book doesn't do justice. No final paper, just a group project.",3.5,4.0,,
I took Dr. Mourao for Engl. Lit.  She's an intelligent thinker.  However..grades on a high standard.  In order to do well & get the most out of the class you need to stay on top of the readings and think about the material analytically.

The material is incredibly interesting on its own but professor Saxonhouse successfully transcended the readings by linking them all together in a way that made perfect sense. Her lectures were as helpful as it can get. If you show up regularly and do the readings to a certain extent then this class is an easy A. ,4.5,3.0, Not Mandatory,
Only take this class if you're 100% interested in the topic. Be prepared to take vigorous notes on everything she says.

you must go to class and READ the chapters to do well in her classes.  The tests are hard with multiple choice and 3 or more pages of short answer and fill in the blank.

"Great professor. Great class. The reason I decided to get a minor in Sociology. The class is fairly simple. Go to class everyday, answer questions on readings and give your opinion. He does pick someone who talks and will do so constantly but its just hilarious for the rest of us to watch the person stumble.",5.0,2.0,,
"He is a great professor who likes to get students involved. There are a few random homework assignments and a paper that was not too bad. Tests are MC and essays.

He is a great professor. He tries to engage students in his lectures and will call on you sometimes but if you read the book and have an opinion it won't matter.

I have learnt so much from this course its crazy. She is truly inspirational. I walked in as a not very confident passive person but walked out with confidence and finally learnt how to be assertive.

I found this class to be extremely interesting and the Prof. was amazing. Anyone who gave the professor a bad rating should be given a bad rating.

His lectures are so fun and engaging. His class helped me the most post grad",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"One of the best professors that I have. He's such a genuine person who really cares about his students. In no way is his class easy but if you have any questions, he is more than willing to help.

Really interesting class and a fun guy - just very lecture heavy and if you skip class you won't pass. He posts slides online but going to class really helps.

Overall, a nice guy and wants you to learn.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Betts is a great guy. The material is not always interesting but his personality makes going to class worth it. You are only graded on 4 tests and the class average is usually a C so you definitely need to study. You dont need the textbook but it does help to study for the exams, so I would suggest getting it. Overall, a good guy and would take",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Honestly my favorite professor here. Last day of class he did a juggling act just bc he wanted to entertain us. Tested money for cocaine residue. Watch CSI clips. Tells stories of crimes that relate to what the lecture is about.

Always willing to discuss anything, understanding of personal troubles, and all-around excellent - engaging, honest, and beyond helpful.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
This was possibly the best professor I had in Kutztown University. He would sit down and explain anything you need help with a thousand times and never give up on you. He only had 4 exam grades.

"He is an awesome professor and the sweetest guy. He understands if you're not a science major and makes things easy to understand. He does interactive stuff and makes lectures interesting.

"Really sweet guy. Knows what he is talking about and is very willing to help. 4 Exams, Multiple choice. Tests aren't difficult but you do need to study if you want to pass.

"Awesome professor. I definitely recommend this class if you're a CJ major. Lectures are interesting and he's great at engaging with the class.

He's extremely helpful as well, will further explain things if you don't understand, and is readily available",5.0,4.0,, Yes
I have taken a class with Dr. Betts before and it was a great class. He WAS a great professor.  During this year there was an extremely noticeable change in his personality.  He  has become a negatively sarcastic individual who is extremely disrespectful of students.  Want help? Get ready to have him treat you like an idiot and ridicule you.,4.0,4.0,,

",4.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Dr Vitz is very wise.  He knows his stuff and wants to share it with students.  That being said if you are not into chem you will have a rough time.

"Probably one of the nicest guys Ihave ever met and is always willing and help. BUT you can't understand him, you ask him one question and he answers you with something else or another question!

"Absolutely the worst professor I have ever had in my life. He gave really clear details on his grading system but completely deviated from them. He did not clarify anything he was teaching.

"I'm in his lab right now, and honestly I get too distracted by all of his ramblings and online stuff that I really don't pick up much information.

"He's a really smart man and he's very nice, but it doesn't say much of him as a professor when most of the class fails the exams. Then again the course is really hard too.

I would take someone else for senior sem.",3.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No

LOTS of reading and classes are kind of boring but he definitely knows what he's talking about.

Overall a good professor.,4.0,3.0, Mandatory,
"His classes are heavily discussion-based. You will lead one class discussion, which isn't hard.

He is also very inspirational to every psych major -- a revered man in the field of psychology.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory,
"This class has a lot of assigned reading (of SIX books you have to purchase) and a lot of open discussion.

The talking about the book is easy because it goes beyond the book and into real life.",4.0,2.0,,

I took this class under the impression it would be easy. And I'm a history buff. It was not the case at all. Everything is essay based and the grading is not easy. Not to mention Langer is not a very good teacher. Extremely boring and somehow makes interesting material mundane. I would reccomend a different teacher.,1.5,4.0,,

Professor Hasenfratz's class was both enjoyable and interesting. He truly cares about his students and is always willing to let you redo work or help you in office hours.

Frederick was extremely racially insensitive and repeatedly singled out students based on their race or ethnicity. He made inappropriate comments regarding suicidal inclination.

He lets you redo papers and helps a LOT.",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory,
"The thing about Biggs is he's very passionate into his research about Medieval lit so even if you're not into it, it'll be a fun class.

"Professor Biggs is a really great professor. He clearly delineates what information he wants you to know for his two exams, and is always open for suggestions - i.e. if you're having trouble with something, he'll make an effort to change it and help you.

"This class made me so miserable it was the topic of many therapy sessions. The grading was unnecessarily hard and, honestly, most of us are convinced she graded some kids harder than others just because she could. If I said ""A"" in a paper, it was right for me and wrong for others, and vice versa. This class ruined my soul and killed my happiness :)",1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Prof. Olson is very kind and doesn't treat the class as more than it actually is. The class is reading a source or two from a textbook, with the following class focused on going through and analyzing the source further. There was a midterm, exam, and a 5-page paper that made up the grade.",4.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Avoid Olson if you can. Every single class consisted of her lecturing in a monotone voice with no form of visual aid or note taking guide for the entire 75 minutes.

She's also a tough grader and requires mastery of knowledge, not just familiarity.",4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"On a personal level, she is a really cool person. It's always nice to see such genuine enthusiasm for a subject. As a senior, the exams are probably the most difficult I've ever taken.

"After completing a hybrid class from him, I would reconsider a choice to take a hybrid/online. A complete lack of resources on canvas means attendance is imperative and using the book is useful. Quizzes are outdated and not completely related to the material. Not a great course in terms of learning or ease of a passing grade, but doable.",1.0,3.0, Mandatory, No
I took his hybrid class for Fridays only. He was always nice. Class starts at 9:30 and thats when he will start lecturing. attendance matters because you have a quiz every class. He tells you everything you need to know for quizzes. Just do the key terms he gives you and any other small assignments and the class is a breeze.,3.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"He was a niceish person, but he refused to do anything online. I had him for a hybrid class and he wouldn't even put our test scores and grades on canvas, he would make US keep track of our grade.

"I'm not sure how I got an A in this class. The tests are a matching style and often there would be vocab/questions on them that I had never heard of.

Mandatory attendance makes it absolutely unbearable",1.5,4.0, Mandatory,

"Dennis doesn't talk much, but he is a good professor. He assigns homework every week, but it is super easy, I don't event think he reads what you write.

He clearly explains the train of thought and logic involved in everything and it made it a lot easier to understand, he allows in class time to finish homework and ask him questions, but, TAKE NOTES, he covers a lot in lecture, if you pay attention you'll do well (also, there's ""pop"" quizzes for readings)",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Great professor.,5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes

"Leahy's hilarious, clear, creative, overall an awesome teacher - I believe he's since retired, so I was glad to have him. 2110 took a lot of studying but was otherwise reasonable; make sure to read the textbook and you'll do fine. When Leahy taught it, there were bi-weekly quizzes instead of exams, which I liked; definitely do the study guides.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Very well structured class and Bill is very funny and a very good lecturer. Weekly quizzes mean you're always up to date on the material.

"What made the class was the TAs. Professor Leahy taught the lecture and the main concepts on how to code in C (specifically for the Gameboy). TAs went over what Leahy taught and ran the labs.

Demos are easy.,5.0,2.0, Mandatory,
"There is a lot to be covered in such a short amount of time, so it may seem overwhelming, but it all builds from the bottom up.

Leahy doesn't like partial credit. Good luck.",4.0,4.0,,

One of the hardest courses in first year. Information from lectures are unclear and unfocused. Vast amount of details from the textbook and many case problems on exams.

"The amount of ""stuff"" in this course is too damn high.",3.5,3.0,,
Worst prof ever. You learn a lot from the textbook if you've never taken international business in high school. The problem is that the midterms and final are not based on any of the lectures or textbook. The business strategy game is stressful. In-class iclicker quizzes do not produce marks unless you score very high in them.,2.5,5.0,,
"What makes this course worse is that the midterms and finals are totally messed. They do not correspond to anything you have learned in the course. The whole point of this course is to get like a 90% before the final exam so you can drop 10% after. But if you get a hard TA and get only a 80% before final exam, then say goodbye to your 131 mark.",1.0,5.0,,

"Like other people are saying, he does know what he's talking about. He isn't very good at teaching though. The classes are really boring and not all that informative. The information from the book, the online modules, and is all different. The main reason for the poorer is because the exams are unclear and aren't related to the course materials.",3.5,2.0,,
"I don't see the issue with this guy.   He clearly has passion for what he teaches and genuinely cares about the students.  Opinions may be skewed because of a bad group in Mike's Bikes, or perhaps the planning of the course which could admittedly be improved.  However without concrete suggestions he always responds to emails and is approachable",4.5,1.0,,

Is the most caring prof that Ive had. He wants everyone to get a good mark. His lectures are very boring and he sometimes jumps around from topic to topic so he is hard to follow. Make sure you read the assigned readings because on the midterms he often asks questions about the small details. Overall.. not bad,3.0,3.0,,
super prof. learned great deal on how to read and interpret literature.  Marvellous,4.5,4.0,,
great great prof.  prof Nicolli has terrific knowledge of medival culture and i learned a lot.  very helpful and understanding.  a must take course,4.0,3.0,,
"Gabe is a terrific guy, he wants everyone to do well. The only thing wrong with him is that his lectures are dull. He has a great knowledge about Italy, and provides numerous examples. He is one of the most personable profs at UW. He treats students with respect, and he receives respect back.",4.5,2.0,,
"FANTASTIC PROF! - the lectures are a little free form, but still interesting, but what makes this class is that the prof cares so much about having every single student do really well.  Very understanding and will go above and beyond to see you succeed.",5.0,2.0,,
"Niccoli is a great racconteur and makes learning fun. In his language courses, he lapses into english too readily -- it would be better if more was raccounted in italian. The Dante course (in english) is an excellent exploration of literature that has shaped modern views. He comunicates his awsome knowledge of literature and culture well.",4.5,3.0,,
"I never thought a better class could be possible. Dante's Inferno with Niccoli drags you through Heaven and Hell, Literally. With Nicolli teaching, everything is right as long as it is justified. Your views are as important to him and the class as his are. A MUST TAKE!",4.5,2.0, Mandatory,
I'm an A+ student and barely passed this class. He changed the weighting of our midterm to be worth more after the class average was 51%. Marking was 50M/50F. His slides focus on content that isn't tested and convolute the content you need to know. The only reason I passed is because he posted previous exams. He is unsympathetic and a harsh marker.,1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
"A good teacher. Is good at explaining concepts, and is very knowledgeable. Good at answering questions, too (knows what the student is asking).   His slides are pretty bad, though. Full of equations and derivations, making it hard to know what's important. He does too many derivations in general.",4.0,3.0,, Yes
"One of the greatest profs, very friendly. His slides are easy very helpful and easy to study from. I really enjoyed taking the class",5.0,3.0, Mandatory,
He doesn't have respect for the students. He is a selfish human being.,1.0,3.0, Not Mandatory,
"He makes polymers so interesting, I didn't do well in organic chemistry before and I wasn't too keen on polymers before taking his class. He keeps every lecture interesting by starting off with some interesting news or application question. I've developed a much better intuition of chemistry in this course than I have in all 3 years of undergrad.",5.0,2.0,,
"He's a quirky prof. He goes over the material too quickly and sometimes his powerpoint slides don't have the answers for the examples (usually the concept questions) in the notes so be careful of that. You get used to the accent. He uses onomatopoeia a lot when he lectures, especially when he's trying to tell a joke/be funny.",3.5,3.0,,
"His slides suck! literally, its so bad its impossible to study from them!",1.0,5.0,,
Best Prof ever ...:),5.0,4.0,,
great Prof :),5.0,4.0,,
Extremely disorganized which makes learning this course a pain.  That's not to say its difficult to get a decent mark as his tests are reasonable.  He lays out material so poorly in his slidesets that learning it is timeconsuming.  If he were more concise and ditched his crappy slide shows he would be much better.,2.5,3.0,,
not bad,3.5,3.0,,
"Pretty entertaining, gave the class the finger once by accident while trying to explain something. Tests were fair as long as you put in the effort to learn the equations and how to use them. Tutorials were basically a road map for the assignments. And he's a nice guy.",3.5,3.0,,

"The most difficult course I never had before. His 351 was much harder than other instructors' 351, I think the workload was the same or more than two same level pmath courses. He is very generous, there are a lots of bonus marks in the assignment and quizzes. The final is a timed exam, it's really hard.",5.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"As noted below, PMATH 351 with prof Davidson was one of the hardest classes I've done so far, however, also the class that I've done the best in. Quizzes and assignments were very heavy and difficult, but were curved pretty generously with bonuses. I have learned so much from this course overall. So sad that he's not teaching anymore :(.",5.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"PMATH 351 is tough and his version is harder than the others', and the workload is very high now that things are online. However, other than workload and difficulty, there should be no complaints at all. Generous bonuses, comprehensive lecture notes, videos, and solutions, helpful Piazza hints. Learned so much from this course.",5.0,5.0,, Yes
"Prof. Davidson is great! Very knowledgeable and hilarious at times in lectures. Can get a bit monotone, but tries to keep us engaged. The homework questions can take a good deal of time to complete, but well worth it and teaches you so much.",4.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"His raw intellectual ability is the sharpest among analysts at UW and he has a professional understanding of how to run a good colloquium or how to organize lectures. If you want to learn analysis, he is the best prof, and he is a very pleasant person. One can go hard at parties or in experimenting with chemicals; Kenny D goes hard on analysis.",5.0,4.0,, Yes
"Analysis felt like a chore about midway through the semester. Yes, we did mathematics but is was proofs that we would be able to do anytime ourselves by 145 standards. My complaint is that the advanced classes are so unbalanced and we do few massively cool things in this class.",4.5,2.0,,
"The assignments were interesting and challenging. The lectures were enjoyable, but (be warned) very fast paced. Every concept is explained clearly and his exams are (comparatively) easy. Lectures were enjoyable.  Simply the best.",5.0,3.0,,
"He went through the material at a very fast pace. Everyone wrote non-stop throughout the class. You will need to review notes after class. He covers material thoroughly though, and lots of it, and really made me like linear algebra. Tests are quite easy.",4.0,4.0,,

Great Professor!! and very approachable,5.0,3.0,,
"He is extremely hard! You need to be sure that you go to class, take good notes (he talks really fast and you have to scribble down the notes really fast), you have to do the reading because the pop quiz answers come directly from the reading and they are hard to remember even if you read. Difficult but a BRILLIANT teacher and very insiteful.",4.0,5.0,,
"Good professor, lectures alot. Take good notes. Gives only quizzes, no tests. Two essay questions throughout the entire class. Write one paper. Study guides are easy and the quizzes are right from the study guide. Easy overall class, but lectures are lengthy.",3.5,2.0,,
"He is very smart and knows a lot about what he is teaching.  His ""quizzes"" (actually tests) are very very hard.  Unless you know a lot about history or love to study during all of your free time I would highly recommend not taking this class.",3.0,4.0,,
Very good professor.. The class is hard but he offers himself alot for any questions you may have.. Extremely knowlegdeable of history and loves it!! It makes it easier to pay attention when you know he enjoys what hes doing! Boring class though just pay attention..,4.5,4.0,,
"CI- Spent entire time on 4 modern history topics in prep to write 10 pg paper. Very knowledgeable, great analysis-quizzes are hard, STUDY THE BOOKS!

INTERESTING class!",5.0,2.0,,
Good teacher - boring class :],4.0,4.0,,
"Dr. Petersen is the toughest man in the world.  In his senior seminar class he once cracked a walnut in half with his bare hands to prove the strength of neolithic man.  He also like Domino's Pizza, and often relates it to the capitalistic system.  Petersen also likes to ski if you want bonus points...buy him pizza and go skiing with him. The man!",5.0,2.0,,
"His quizzes are pretty tough, but his lectures were interesting.",4.0,4.0,,
Peterson is one of the most intelligent history professors ever! he could talk about the topics forever. i kept getting continuous C's on my quizzes but he gave out a lot of extra credit--you really have to work for it though! yes for my class we had to write a 5 pg paper off of one source-but my god its an entire book to go off of!!,4.5,4.0,,
"Professor Peterson is a terrible professor.  He is really interested in what he is teaching but is not clear at all.  I'm an ""A"" student and got a C in this class.  He is so unclear about what will be on the tests I didn't know what to study.  Avoid!!",1.5,5.0,,
"His lectures were often captivating, and an excellent analytical supplement to the books. Exams were balanced and demanding, although the essays could have required more analysis. Recommended for history and int'l relations students  that have already completed some coursework in their fields.",4.5,3.0,,
"He is a ridiculous teacher. You must write a five page paper using one source. If you use more, you get marked down. AVOID!",1.0,5.0,,
"Terrible prof. Patronizing and cruel. He's enthusiastic to teach, but is a firm believer in ""smart"" and ""stupid"" people. Frequently says ""if you didn't get this right, then you're just stupid."" Avoid him. I took this class for fun (4th year) and if I had him my first year I would have transferred.",2.5,4.0,,
"Likes to teach the material.  Very enthusiastic.  You will need to study. You do need the book for reading.  Have to write a 3-5 page paper on the cuban missile crisis, or at least my class did.",3.5,3.0,,

"Dr. Peterson is a brilliant human being.  I had him about 10 years ago, so maybe my ratings are not relevant.  He will work you hard, and your grade may not be the pretty little ""A"" you want, but speaking from experience, I REMEMBER more from his classes than any other.  He may seem intimidating, but one:one, you'll see a different person.",4.5,4.0,,

"Please at all costs avoid this teacher! We are waiting for final grades still and we as a class have no idea where we stand.

She is demeaning when you ask questions.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory,

Don't take her for your own mental health and sanity.PLEASE",1.0,5.0, Mandatory,

"Do not take this class. The credit is not worth it, trust me. She is always confused and doesnt even go by her name. You dont know your grades till the end of the semester and is clear about nothing. You will be able to be fluent in a new language before you can read her handwriting. It just not worth it.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"Yeah, no. She was just not good. There are professors that want to teach, and then there is Professor Hastings. You can't read any of her handwriting on the papers she gives back. Very condescending and belittling, makes you feel extremely stupid for asking simple questions. Take with a different professor if you can.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No

Would highly suggest taking it with a different prof.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
I took this class as a gen-ed and this was by far THE HARDEST CLASS I HAVE EVER HAD! She spends the majority of the class talking about things that are not relevant. Maybe have about 20 productive minutes of class a day! The only part of this class I enjoyed was the groups we created ourselves because your group will be the only help you'll get.,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"The absolute worst teacher I have ever had. Im close to a 4.0 student and struggled through this class. At times I just wanted to drop out because of this class.
