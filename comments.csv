"To anyone reading this questioning whether they should take Stat 435 with Stefan - do it. It will be the best decision of your undergrad. Easily my favourite professor Ive had, clear lectures, group work that is applicable to real life statistics, etc. Take home midterm, open book final. Do your work, pay attention, easy 80+. TAKE THIS CLASS.",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"instructions are unclear, too many workloads. He made us hand in a report every week which require a lot of investigaions and time. However, his instructions are unclear, usually dun know what to do.",1.5,4.0, Mandatory,
"Good prof. A bit mundane but its a stat course so kinda of expected. Midterms are hard but the final made up for it. He cares about his students even though he doesn't show it. The course material looks boring but once you study it bit further, you'll enjoy the material.",4.0,3.0,,
"Great notes, lots of examples. Fair tests and final. A nice guy",5.0,1.0,,
"His notes are very helpful and organized. He is really good at explaining and teaching. Very approachable too. He would provide past tests and assignments for references. He also reviews tests. Also, in the beginning of each class, he would do a quick review to help students to keep on track of the materials.",5.0,3.0,,
Really knowledgeable. Very helpful to students in and out of class. Really nice and a pleasure to have as a prof!,4.5,2.0,,
"The worse prof I ever had. He did not care one bit, taught from slides that made no sense and couldn't even solve the proofs himself. Avoid at all costs!",1.0,5.0,,
Dry but effective.  Friendly and approachable demeanor.,4.0,3.0,,
A very very annoying course. But he did his level best to make it interesting. Enthusiastic about the topic and gives good notes. If you have to take the course (and it's mandatory) take it with him.,5.0,2.0,,
soso..but his note is really good!! but no more examples about cars plz!!!,3.0,3.0,,
"Pretty good. Could be more energetic/funny but comparing to most, a very good prof",4.0,2.0,,
Pretty good explanations especially considering the course materials.  Excellent notes!,4.5,2.0,,

Pretty good oral presentation and good explanations for questions,4.0,3.0, Mandatory,
good course notes,4.0,4.0,,
"His lectures are fun to attend to since its as if he's story telling. His tests are essay writing but he will tell you about whats going to be on it as early as week #2. The key points to passing his class is to sit around the front row, take notes during his lecture and make sure they're neat AND most importantly, don't miss any lectures or labs!",4.0,4.0,,
One of the hardest markers I have even seen in my life.,3.0,5.0,,
"I love this guy! He's just plain magic!! He is a good teacher. His lectures are really good. The way he teaches about the various protocols is interesting and easy to remember. Ian is a great teacher, he really knows his stuff. If you walk into his class ready to learn and write a lot, you'll do really well.  Ian Allison is an great teacher.",4.5,1.0,,
"Expect google to be your professor. No additional material other then lectures. sure his lectures are different, and makes you laugh at times. but if you have difficulty following the lecture, dont expect any additional help. Lab classes are also fairly useless.",1.5,5.0,,
"Hands down the best lecturer I've ever had.  Makes boring and obsolete topics interesting.  He's informal and it makes it easier to relate to him.  He's a super hard marker and his tests are killer.  TAKE NOTES.  Write down EVERYTHING he says, as the tests are directly based on the lectures.  Essay format, one mark per paragraph.",4.5,5.0,,
"Good teacher, knows his stuff. expects a lot from students come midterm time. expect to write 10 essays in less than 2 hours. No one finishes his midterm. Cool guy, just a hard marker and hard on students. get on his good side and he'll get on yours.",4.5,4.0,,
"Ian is a great teacher, he really knows his stuff. If you walk into his class ready to learn and write a lot, you'll do really well. Study at least a week in advance for both the midterm and the exam as you'll be writing about 45 paragraphs for each. Tests are more of memorization than knowledge, but if you know it, you'll remember it. He's awesome",4.5,5.0,,
"Awesome, especially when it's steak day!",5.0,5.0,,
"Best prof. And by best I mean he is the hardest marking dude around. Despite this, I managed to pass when 75% didn't. He decided to give us an ""easy"" final in order to get his rating up here on this site while he was away on vacation. I guess he hoped people would think he changed his ways but...he definitely won't. Cheers Ian!",3.5,5.0,,
"The Midterm and Final Exam are both given in essay/question format. Each mark is basically one paragraph on what is lectured weekly. You will need to other students and friends for notes and/or do research on your own. Put in WORK. Do not feel bad if you fail the first time. One of the harder courses in the program, but you will come out a WINNER.",4.0,5.0,,
"Thank you for giving me ""B+"" after the first ""F"" I got from you. Thanks Ian ;)",3.0,4.0,,
I love this guy.  He's the best.  Although he doesn't know whats going he's so cute.,1.0,5.0,,
"This guy is always in a different planet.  Perhaps instead of teaching us all he thinks or dreams about his johnny walker.  Way to go, professor.  See you in the next class after all the Fs you gave me.  Thanks i appreciate it.  See ya soon.",5.0,1.0,,
"Wants you to memorize information and write essays for your exams. Did not help during labs and even though this is a very important course, you do not learn anything if taking it with this teacher. In my opinion he came **** to every lab class ... very unprofessional.",3.0,4.0,,
"He is a good teacher. His lectures are really good. The way he teaches about the various protocols is interesting and easy to remember. However you need to put hard work else you will fail this course, because his expectation is very high. He is not much helpful in labs. However if you put your effort and learn it you will understand.",3.5,5.0,,
"In the lab his useless. Lectures he know everything no slides.He makes his tests impossible to remember. His older the then the protocols he teaches. Somewhat funny. ""When you guys go to party talk about data com stuff the girls will love you.""  Tests are way to difficult to remember everything he wants. He needs to cut back on the drinking tho.",3.0,5.0,,
"Hard classes, nice prof. Very charismatic and funny. Has a very peculiar way to teach. Usually on his breaks u can spot him at the bar (... Hill) at York Lanes taking beers with Scott.",4.5,5.0,,
"Well after a stop at the blueberry hill and a smoke he will always fill the class with excitement, walking around the class to each student this guy will keep you on your feet. He knows his stuff, the only teacher i have had at Seneca that teaches 100% true without aid, and for people who think you can skip, his basement is already full of scotch!!",3.5,1.0,,
"He is an idol for ""old school"". I felt like an illiterate during his lectures. Never seen a professor giving a lecture completely from his head without using any visual aid and without a single mistake in technical description. No wonder all other profs tell you go to him for datacom questions.",4.5,4.0,,
Ian Allison will kick your ass! You will walk into his class soft and leave carved out of wood... ask him to teach you assembly if you're breezing through Datacom.,5.0,5.0,,
"He is my favorite Seneca professor. I don't attend the classes because they are asynchronous, but I watched all of his videos to prepare for quizzes, examinations, and labs. Taking notes of the commands will help you achieve a high grade. He also has a great voice and explains the complex material in an easy to comprehend manner.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
hard marking,1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory,
"Made learning Linux fun. Interesting lectures, knows his stuff. Quizzes were a bit tricky but if you studied the material it wasn't a problem. Usually responded to emails within a day.",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"He knows how to teach, his material is well organized into video sections step by step, he puts emphasis on clear communication and uses calendar (halelluja!) Seneca should just let him teach 100% online as his way of online teaching is exemplary and really well executed. Lecture heavy but If you have a bad grade, not his fault. Really nice voice.",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"When I see reviews crying about difficulty, it's not Brian's fault. He gives THE BEST online lectures I've seen in Seneca. He also covers the material with his step-by-step videos for each part of the course. He is enormously approachable and kind but mutual respect has to be shown. Brian will teach you SO MUCH but don't expect the grade for free",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
Just take him very easy grader. If you put a little effort and attend classes or even watch recorded classes syou would pass you just need a little practice with commands. Tests are very easy and interesting. He is the best prof for this course.,5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Really great professor, very dedicated. Patiently answers any questions anybody has. Yes, there are a lot of quizzes, but if you sit through his classes or go through his course videos, it won't be too difficult. He also goes through the answers after each quiz - super helpful, not many professors do that. I'd definitely take him again.",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
One of the best professor i had. Learn a lot from him!,5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Quizzes are hard and every things are matter.,1.0,2.0, Not Mandatory,
"Pretty Straight Foward guy, lots of quizzes, tests, and assignments, like probably 2-3 quizzes a week, but normally everything is explained in slides, couldn't really keep up with his lectures, would zone out from time to time, makes the course time consuming, wouldn't really take again",2.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
Easy to understand and great at explaining things.,5.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"I don't understand the policy that If u fail the final test although that u did perfectly in everything else, u get an F!!!!",2.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
"It was a great course overall and the professor made Linux look easy rather than making students cram it, practical knowledge was more emphasized.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Brian Gray is great. He knows the material very well, he has a wonderful voice and you enjoy listening to his lectures.",5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Knows the material, but is boring to listen to (may be the material's fault). Marks are all subjective, there's no part marks. Doesn't always read his emails properly.",3.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Brian Gray is a good lecturer. If you ask question he explains. However, he is rude. He directly does not say bad word to anyone, but his tone of voice prevents you from asking your question.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Won't make an effort to show up if he doesn't need to be there for testing. Even if it does happen to be test day, flip a coin if class is cancelled. Even when he is teaching the lecture it is extremely barebones. I think I learned nothing from his course except how to read lab instructions. Super easy course.",1.0,2.0, Mandatory, No
He is one of the best professors in Seneca for any Linux courses I must say. He evaluates our exam paper in a way to bring perfection in our learning. I really appreciate his feedback.,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
He is horrible,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"Before him I was taking at least 3 online courses, but Brian's explanation was the best. You have to put some effort into Assignments and do them again and again and you'll definitely pass.",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"I had him for first year, and I thought he was a decent lecturer. But as the years went by, I realized that he did not prepare me well. There's a difference between getting through a course, and then getting you ready for the next course. I wish he would have taught a deeper understanding of the concepts versus making everything easy.",2.0,2.0, Mandatory, No
"Ian is a really nice guy. But he only touches the surface of each concept. When you ask for more details, he doesn't know them. That's good for those who just want to pass the course, since he teaches easy and has great lectures. He tries to avoid tougher questions and does not follow up, but expects you to read up on it yourself.",2.0,3.0,, No
Really amazing prof. Didn't like the course too much but he was great.,5.0,3.0,, Yes
"Ian is just great! The best professor I've had. Very clear, organized and engaging.",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory,
"What I like most about Vanderburgh is that he explains everything very clearly while also keeping the interest of students who know the material. He's funny, very intelligent and makes it a joy to be in class. Also, even though he's a busy guy, he's always helpful if you ask.  Absolutely the best prof I have.",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory,
One of my favourite prof!,5.0,1.0,,
"He was our substitute teacher for a couple of math137 lectures, and he was awesome, as always. I actually chose to come to UW partially because of him! I was in a week long math seminar at uw during grade 12 and luckily had him as our lecturer. That's how good he is!!",5.0,2.0,,
"The side-effect of having Ian as a first-year course prof is that I am now forever comparing other profs to him and none is even remotely comparable (well, perhaps with the exception of Joe West).  Also, he seems to be an all-around accomplished guy.  Hell, he plays piano for our school choir and runs marathon annually, what else can he NOT do?",5.0,3.0,,
"Just awesome, period!",5.0,3.0,,
He is one of the best profs in u of w I think. I have taken math 135 and Pmath 340 with him. His class was very interesting and not very hard to follow. I strongly suggest him to be your first Math 135 prof if you are a new math students in u of w.,5.0,3.0,,
BEST PROF EVER!!!,5.0,1.0,,
One of a kind!,5.0,1.0,,
"Absolutely amazing professor. If you can take any course with him, DO IT.",5.0,2.0,,
"What else can I say?  Read all his ""fans'"" comments, they're all true. :)  GO TO HIS CLASS!!!!  I was inspired to go to his 8:30am class just to hear lecture!! Teaches BETTER than the textbook--no need to buy course material as long as you attend all his lectures! He's SO friendly, and will know your name--such a young course coordinator!(only 30!)",5.0,2.0,,
"Ian is my GOD!! Not going to his classes should definitely be a crime! He was so nice and helpful. When our class clapped when he told us he was engaged he blushed, funniest thing ever. I think we should work on cloning Ian multiple times to teach all math classes!!",5.0,3.0,,
"Ian was by far the best professor I had this semester.  He is extremely knowledgeable, really teaches the material well, and he's pretty funny at times.  I actually really enjoyed the class just because of how great of a prof Ian was.  I would definitely recommend his classes",5.0,2.0,,
his class is the only class i even consider going to at 8:30 in the morning... although i still fail at waking up....,5.0,2.0,,
"Everyone was saying how great of a prof. he was but I didn't know until I took this class... and yeah, definitely one of the best!",5.0,3.0,,
"Ian is absolutely wonderful!  He's really patient with questions... if you have the slightest chance to take his class, take it!  It's well worth the extra work!",5.0,3.0,,
"The only prof Ive had who made the class so interesting, I would have rather gone to class than teach it to myself! Amazing people skills.",5.0,2.0,,
"Amazing teacher, I would recommend him.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I took his fitness and conditioning class completely frightened of being yelled at and such, but it was completely the opposite! Les is such a kind professor, slightly traditional, but super motivating. He helps create a ""running culture"" for the entire class and I've really enjoyed my time in his class. It's actually my favourite.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Les is a relatable prof who you can speak to at any time about anything. He challenges you in your schooling, but also in your daily life. He's rememberable and you always take something away from his class each day.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Les is a unique professor that veers away from traditional textbook learning and immerses his students with engaging discussion. His views on holistic wellness are a great example to live your life by. Only con is that the final exam is worth a ton on textbook material that we hardly covered in class. He needs to tie up the evaluation a bit.,5.0,3.0,,
"Les is honestly the most motivational man I've  ever had the pleasure of meeting. He is tough but he pushes you to be your best. In the running class he is supportive and fair and basis marks off of your attitude. In his lecture, if you put in the work Les makes sure you are rewarded. Great teacher! Highly recommended!!!",5.0,3.0, Mandatory,
"so helpful, especially for international students. simply, the best.",5.0,1.0,,
"learning is done in Les's class not through rote memorization or boring lectures but through experience, thought provoking excersise and real life down to earth examples that Les brings in from all areas. Amazing prof whose classes will change you for the better!",5.0,2.0,,
"Great prof! Very Passionate, enthusiastic, motivated, outgoing and experienced. He knows what he's talking about. Grades are determined based on your performance, attitude and effort. Highly recommended !",5.0,2.0,,
"No structure. Every class i've taken with Les has been a struggle to get through.  All I had in my notes from lectures were his favorite quotes he told us to write down. Needs to TEACH, not PREACH.  Every semester during the last week of class he hits us with 15 chapters we didn't cover which are on the exam.  Went to 30% of classes and got an A",1.5,1.0,,
"This man has a giant heart, he is very passionate about what he does. Good teacher, makes me feel like a bad person!",3.5,1.0,,
"His assignments were good an insightful, but they were worth pretty much nothing. The final exam was worth a whopping 40% and had absolutely nothing to do with what he said in class. The final is only from the textbook - and it is a very tough and long exam. You pretty much have to memorize every chapter in order to do well.",1.5,4.0,,
"EXCELLENT teacher. He knows his material, and is always pure and good to all his students. I admire all his beliefs and practices. He is a healthy man, and inspiring to all students. I would definelty recommend taking one of his classes, as you will find out for yourself how great of a person he is. There is not many people like him, and I love him",5.0,3.0,,
the most enriching man i know whos passionate and creates a culture of wellness in everyone he meets.  gets to know all of his students individually and is a strong inspiration to all the teams in the athletics department.  love the man!,4.0,4.0,,
"just an amazin person...makes u think twice about what u throw into ur body thurs nights at the foundary, his tests arent alot on lecture.but this is by far the best class ive ever taken...cant wait to take another one:D",4.0,1.0,,
3rd class now with Les.  Such a class act!  Such a unique and passionate individual.  I think he should rule the world.,4.5,2.0,,
"Awesome teacher, so passionate about what he teaches. Makes me want to be a healthier, better person. I would recommend any class with Les",4.0,3.0,,
"Les is the reason why I am a healthy indavudual and not diabetic and 400 pounds. He changed my life with his passion towards health and wellness. I own my life to this man and he is the reason why I am going to be a teacher to do the same for other students. Take any of his classes, you will never, ever, regret it.",5.0,4.0,,
"Les is full of passionate energy and has a uncanny nack for getting his students to really become involved in the world of Physical Education. My only problem with Les is, he is very unclear in his teaching style. I recommend that you enroll in his running class, you will not regret it!",3.5,3.0,,
An Inspiring Teacher! Les is one in a million.,5.0,3.0,,
Les is a really nice guy and was a nice change to have from all the other ED courses,4.0,2.0,,
"Best teacher I ever met. Patient, kind, encouraging till I caught up, then inspiring, w/high expectations. Brought out all our different strengths, while always helping us improve. Amazing readings every class.Studying w/Tim was a high point of my life.The ribs creak & strain with the love. & poems come. Class was a great joy to me.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Professor Seibles is a true gem. I took an intro Creative Writing class just for kicks with him in 2001, and graduated with a degree in English in 2004. That was definitely not my plan when I started at ODU. I specifically sought out and took every class I could with him - 4 or 5. I follow him to this day, he is the Poet Laureate of Virginia!",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I know everyone thinks Siebels is some kind of poetry God,but as an older student, while an easy teacher, I found him to be a narcissistreads too much of his own stuff, smiles like a phony and knows hes good looking. Do the readings, come to class,participate, and youll get an A.",2.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Professor Seibles is a very well respected professor. I enjoyed taking his 112 ENG class! He made the class very interesting by reciting various poems, some that he wrote. Also, he encourages participation at all times, it essential to your grade! Participation was fun and I enjoyed listening to the other students point of views as well. Read!",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
Professor Seibles is an amazing professor a published poet and awesome teacher. He gets down to our level he understands were students love to share his poem with the class no tests just weekly reading which is fairly easy. Had three assignments very forgiving lets you rewrite mid term. Gives great feedback and enjoyable class I highly recommend.,5.0,1.0, Mandatory, Yes
Professor Seibles is one of my favorite professors at ODU. He emphasizes that he wants you to pass his class with an A. He just wants you to participate in the class discussions and really read and keep an open mind when reading. He understands that not everyone is an English major and reads and writes like one. He is a very conscientious grader.,5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
It's true when they say his class is like a black history class. He really just wants you to think for yourself. Overall a good class,4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Seibles was actually my favorite professor I've had so far at Old Dominion. The class requires a lot of reading from a giant book with small text but as long as you read you should be okay.  There are quite a few short papers and quizzes but like I said, if you keep up with the reading your grade should reflect that. He's very big on participation and he likes to hear the ideas of everyone in class. He definitely tries to keep and open mind and seeks to understand the ideas of others. I would recommend taking Seibles over some of the other English professors I've come across so far.",3.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Seibles is amazing. He is a wonderful poet and he wants his students to grow and be successful. He is also very humorous and has such a kind soul. I wish I could take every literature class with him. MAKE SURE you do the readings weekly though because class discussion is a big chunk of your grade & there are pop quizzes (quizzes are very easy).,5.0,1.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Professor Seibles is fantastic. He is an amazing poet and really helps you to improve your writing skills. He knows we are students, so he doesn't expect perfection, but he does expect a basic knowledge of proper punctuation and sentence structure (you are in college after all). I highly recommend him if you are interested in being a writer!",5.0,1.0, Mandatory,
"Seibles is fantastic.  He understands rhythm and words like no other professor can explain.  The way he speaks helped me visualize patterns and the effects of word and line length.  Where other professors are technical, Seibles knows how to get to the primal understanding of language.",5.0,1.0, Mandatory,
"Tim is the best! He is an awesome teacher, who keeps his students interest at every turn. He is wonderful! He is hot.",5.0,2.0,,
He can toss his can of chili around with the best of them,4.5,4.0,,
"Seibles is the poetry man! If you enjoy a teacher with real passion for the subject and creative assignments then take him. He loves to compare poetry to jazz and will make a class go outside to write. Anyone who says a 50 plus year old man can't be sexy obviously has not heard him out-loud. His voice can melt hearts (cliche, I know).",4.5,1.0,,
Tim is awesome! I would not be where I am today if it were not for his wonderful teaching and expertise.,5.0,2.0,,
"If you are a Creative Writing Major at ODU, you must run not walk and take Professor Seibles class. He is a well established mentor to all future poets at ODU and an overall great guy. The class is inspiring and if you're lucky to have a great group of classmates. Unforgettable.",5.0,2.0,,
"Great teacher. His main point to the class was for you to open your world to other people and ideas. He's a pretty liberal guy, so if you swing the other way, you might not enjoy the class so much. Picks readings from a wide variety of authors and poets. Class was very enjoyable for myself, I was actually sad to have to miss a few while sick.",4.5,3.0,,
"great teacher, very knowledgeable. classes were rather boring though.",4.0,3.0,,
"Just a note--Seibles is in his 50s so I don't know about those hot peppers! He has great style--he is engaging and encouraging, and his expressiveness really helps move you along in your own creativity. Though I like the man, I did not enjoy the course because for a creative writing class it was entirely too book-heavy! Oral quizzes daily, yuck!",4.0,3.0,,
"Very focused on himself and his own ideas, and not enough time given at all to the texts and alternate readings of them. Friendly and entertaining, but I hated going to class--felt like a waste of time.",3.0,1.0,,
"She was very nice, however you only have 2 or 3 grades for the class which made it stressful.",2.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
"I loved this class, I was a freshman here at ODU so this class was one of my first ever college classes! Prof. is very caring about her students and very kind! You can tell she is very passionate about what she does and it makes class fun. If you do not like to read, do not take her. You will do a lot of reading, but the readings are interesting!!!",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I took this class to complete a gen ed requirement this semester. She grades too hard, and I didn't get any of the grades I deserved. I put in so much work and didn't get the outcome I wanted. The lectures are boring and I would never even think about taking this class again.",1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
Nothing,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"For a night class in the dead of winter, this professor was even colder. rarely smiled & a little insulting in her feedback. Worst part of my entire master's program experience. I determined that if I ever decided to teach, I would be the opposite of this professor - encouraging, engaging and someone who gets you excited about the material",1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"Pretentious and cold. The material for her classes is the same for every course she teaches, which is bad enough, but her husband teaches the exact same material as well.",1.0,2.0,, No
"I never met a teacher so unwilling to listen. On a number of occasions she specifically objected to an older learner for having a viewpoint, especially a viewpoint against her own. Complained about her workload and graded off by personality instead of actual knowledge. She seriously needs to stop thinking she's unprejudiced.",1.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, No
This was the worst class I've taken at ODU. She loves the material but if you don't you will struggle with it. She is a harsh grader and gives very little clarification on why you received the grade you did. There are not many graded assignments in the course and so the Final paper ends up being 50% of the grade!,1.0,3.0, Mandatory, No
"The world of cultural and literary theory cannot be squeezed into one semester.  Before taking this class, I wish I had read the text book like 5 times.  There are so many abstract concepts.  Professor Mourao was okay, but I think her expectations were a little high.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory,
"superb professor! Her teaching style compliments all texts studied in class, as historical background figures largely into time period consideration and novel publication. She is kind, brilliant, and, above all, really wants her students to understand the material and succeed. One of the best profs I've ever had the pleasure of encountering!",5.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"Good teacher, good person. Very funny. NEED TEXTBOOK, buy on Amazon. If you do the readings, you should be fine. There is a quiz every day before class. The class was pretty hard, not much work, a lot of listening. She is a nice person and a good teacher though, but I might not take her again. Disliked the class but I like her.",5.0,4.0,,
"Professor Mourao loves British literature which is cool, but it means she only lectures. She is very kind and understanding, but not necessarily helpful. Quiz every class and the tests are meant to test your understanding of a few of the dozens of concepts she brings up in class. The point is, this class is great but difficult to do well in.",3.5,4.0,,
"Prof. Mourao is a brilliant woman who loves what she teaches. Unfortunately, she wants everyone else to love it too, and if you don't, sucks to be you.  Quiz almost every class, so if you want to pass, READ.",2.0,3.0,,
"Very intelligent. Rather rough, but the class is crit. theory so that's expected. A fair yet almost tough grader. You can't BS her. My advice is attend if not all, most classes, the book doesn't do justice. No final paper, just a group project.",3.5,4.0,,
I took Dr. Mourao for Engl. Lit.  She's an intelligent thinker.  However..grades on a high standard.  In order to do well & get the most out of the class you need to stay on top of the readings and think about the material analytically.

Her lectures were as helpful as it can get. If you show up regularly and do the readings to a certain extent then this class is an easy A. ,4.5,3.0, Not Mandatory,
Only take this class if you're 100% interested in the topic. Be prepared to take vigorous notes on everything she says.  She doesn't accept outside opinions because she's convinced everything she says is the only answer.  The tests are graded partially by her but also by a GSI who has told me that even she gets confused by what Arlene says in lec.,3.0,4.0,,
Lectures tend to be long and brutally boring. She speaks very quietly and is hard to understand. Do not take this class with her. You will be in for a painfully boring and tough semester dragging yourself to class. ,1.0,4.0,,

"The class involves a lot of reading and 3 essays, but that was it. Attendance is mandatory, and you must participate and pay attention constantly in class.

"The whole class was, understandably, based off reading the Federalist Papers, but we also read it in class together, which cut into time for discussing and analyzing the text.

Worst prof I have ever come across. Occasionally decides to not show up to lectures without telling his students. Makes tons of mistakes on the board.

"Unfortunately the lectures are quite boring and not well planned. The prelectures are mandatory if you want to actually learn, and then he spends 20 mins in class solving one matrix, then the class is over (30 mins early). He is very monotone and it's not interesting to listen to him.",1.0,2.0, Not Mandatory,
"One of the best math professors you will ever have. Although not directly taking his class, his pre-lectures were good and always got to the point.

Amazing ,5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

All concepts are taught as online videos that should be watched before lectures. Straightforward, doesn't skip steps, and great pace!",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Came into stats scared because of what everyone had told me, however, it was my favourite course this semester, because Dr.Childs was such an amazing professor. His lectures were taught so well.

His course format is so easy to understand and follow along. He really understands the learning process and thats reflected in the way he teaches.,5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Great structure in terms of the way the course is laid out. Pre-recorded lectures teach you the content while the live lectures which are Q&A sessions so that people can't get him off track answer personal detailed questions and go over specific examples.

"LOVE HIM!! He's a great prof (although a bit of a slow speaker), you can get a hold of him pretty quickly through MS teams and he's just fun overall. Reminds me of Mr. Rogers.

Professor Childs is a god sent. His lectures make you understand what to do and all you need is some practice. The pre-lectures are very easy to follow and not too drawn-out. The live sessions he does examples and answers most questions. Once he even taught us calc:) And before lecs where people ask silly questions is quite funny too.

"Dr. Johnson seems like a nice person. But he fails to present class concepts clearly, often times he will leave variables in lecture and never assign a name to them. Lectures are half chopped (you need to read the textbook and lectures to see what his preference for things are). Overall not a pleasant class to take because of that.",1.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No

Choose the project over midterm if you have time for it--will learn a lot.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Excellent course, taught in very liberal fashion. Take out the effort you put in. Relates it all back to core eng concepts, and examines very fairly. Lots of personal anecdotes. Pawns off to guest lecturers for half the course, so you get to meet some cool industry incumbents. Do the work yourself, and you'll succeed. 'Team Eng' will get you a 78.",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes

"This professor is very knowledgeable and if you are taking the Supply Chain and Operations program he will be by far the most valuable in terms of take home knowledge.

His classes are very educational, but they are not pleasant due to him.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No

Learn his specific wording to get the best marks.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes

"Although Brian is not very approachable and empathetic for slacking students, he is very passionate about learning and excellence. He has very high standards. Somtimes I found that we connected quite well when other could not with him. I think the reason for that is because I was able to identify my weaknesses and be open-minded to his ideas.",3.5,3.0, Mandatory,
"I think a lot of students dislike this class because they don't put in the work.  The concepts aren't always intuitive, and require attendance, participation, and preparation.

"Was a bit irked at first because it seemed more like a philosophy course than an English course, but readings pay off because many of the texts show up in later English courses. Had 'writing workshops' and formative feedback for papers which helped to not procrastinate and do really well. Attendance mandatory: -2.5% per missed class!",4.5,2.0, Mandatory,
"Dr. Easton was very knowledgeable about the field. I like the way the course was designed, particularly the structuring of the readings. Though his feedback on essays and seminars was minimal, he was helpful when consulting with students.  He has a solid grasp of each of the texts studied and is able to point out relevant passages for the class.",4.0,3.0,,
"An interesting course with well-chosen, complimentary readings. Valuable for English majors or if you have a keen interest in 18th-c. fiction. He's great with Jane Austen!

"Nice guy, but I absolutly despised the content (all romance novels in an 18th C lit course). He was always late for class, and I was constantly watching the clock all through lectures.

"Books aren't bad, although for some reason he chooses ones you've never heard of.  Also he is very pretentious, and uses alot of big words you don't understand.

I found this class to be extremely interesting and the Prof. was amazing. Anyone who gave the professor a bad rating should be given a bad rating.

I have taken a class with Dr. Betts before and it was a great class. He WAS a great professor.  During this year there was an extremely noticeable change in his personality.

"Dr. Rains is very knowledgable. This class is discussion based upon a music theory book... I hated this class because to me, it had NOTHING to do with psychology. I have no music background and no interest in it. You have to lead class 2 times, 2 tests, cumulative final, 2 papers based upon classical music. I would take someone else for senior sem.",3.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
"His class can be overall frustrating as he uses no powerpoints and reads off of a paper. Classes are based on discussion and he assigns 10 books to read with only 3 exams (midterm, last test and final) final is cumulative. Did not read one of the books and got b's on his exam as he discusses it in class. He's a caring professor and knows his stuff",3.0,3.0, Mandatory, No
"Dr. Rains is an awesome professor. I am going to miss him. He is detailed/clear with the work he expects and presents. Dr. Rains has a radical way of thinking and processing information. He does not think in a fixed manner which is a blessing considering some of the professors I have encountered. If you can take a class with Dr. Rains, take it!!!!!",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Rains is hands down my favorite professor for pyschology I had. He has a fake eye which can be distracting but give him a chance. He's really inspirational and intelligent. He assigns a lot of books but if you come to class you can get away with not reading. Participate in the discussions. I'm taking him again. Had him for psych of personality,5.0,3.0, Mandatory,
LOTS of reading and classes are kind of boring but he definitely knows what he's talking about. Does take attendance which is worth 15% of your grade but you're allowed to miss 6 classes without penalty. Anymore and you lose points. You have to lead a discussion but it's not too bad. Overall a good professor.,4.0,3.0, Mandatory,
"His classes are heavily discussion-based. You will lead one class discussion, which isn't hard. Reading the textbooks are a must, but he always holds review sessions before each exam so you know what's on the test. He takes attendance. He is also very inspirational to every psych major -- a revered man in the field of psychology.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory,
"This class has a lot of assigned reading (of SIX books you have to purchase) and a lot of open discussion. Can be a bore, but if you perk up and pay attention and read like 50% of the material you can pull a B. Attendance also boosts your grade but it's hard to stay interested in this class. If you're an abstract thinker you'll like this class.",4.0,3.0,,
"grades are only based on attendance &2 tests, he expects you to read upwards of 6 books over the course of the semester &his lectures are boring&confusing. he's a nice guy but his class was unnecessarily hard",1.5,5.0,,
"Unless you want to buy 4-8 books per class, read them and realize that noone else has read them and that Rains does not even directly test upon the readings, then take him. He's a sweet old man but he's so vague, and I learned nothing about Psych of Personality from him. If you want an easy A, go for it but you won't learn anything from him.",2.5,2.0,,
"His lectures are a little boring, but overall he is straightforward and a good professor.",4.5,3.0,,
"Prof. Rains is a genuinely nice person who cares alot about what he teaches. Sometimes he has a hard time gathering all of his thoughts to explain them, but he knows very well his subject and will explain anything as many times as you want. Tests are easy if you pay attention and study. I hear he isnt good for senior sem., though, I'm in abnormal.",4.5,2.0,,
"Prof Rains is such a nice guy, you can talk about anything is class and he respects you. Yeah you have to read for his class, which is reasonable, duh its college. Tests arent the easiest but they are fair. His sr sem. class made me appreciate him a lot more than when i had him for physiological psych. He is very smart and kind!!!",4.5,3.0,,
"Dr. Rains is fun! I'm really enjoying this class.  Go ahead, take him. *thumbs up*",5.0,2.0,,
"What a joke.  He didn't even teach, he had the students run the discussions.  In his intro to the course, he told us ""We're not going to spend time on some topics.  Here they are, let's discuss them.""  What a quack.",1.5,4.0,,
"Pretty much, this class is like a book club. You read what you need to and then come in and talk about the psychology/philosophy behind it. It looks like a lot of reading, but it really isn't because the books are really awesome to read. (Hard to believe, huh?) The talking about the book is easy because it goes beyond the book and into real life.",4.0,2.0,,
"has a socratic method of teaching. he wants you to talk and help to facilitate the learning of the entire class, himself included. If you have a class full of people with social phobia it can be painful, but if people are willing to talk it is enlightening. There is a large reading load for some classes.",4.0,2.0,,
Dr. Rains is a very knowledgable professor who cares about his students and loves his job. He is always asking the students for feedback and looking for ways to improve the class. The people who give him bad ratings are simply too lazy to do the readings and probably shouldn't be in college anyway.,4.0,3.0,,

"Very nice woman, however, tests are strangely worded. And 75% of your grade is just tests. Remember that law she explained for 2 minutes and you didn't get the chance to write down? It's on the test. Interesting class, hard to ace though.",5.0,3.0,,
"Great Professor!! Make sure you take notes, and read the book, everything she gives you including handouts and guest speakers are on the tests.

Dr. Zayaitz is without question to best professor that I've had. I look forward to waking up at 9:30 to go to her class. It is a helpful class that is ACTUALLY useful in everyday life (hence the name bio and society)...but it is an easy class to sit thru. Tests aren't hard if you show up in class & take notes.

"she is a great teacher. she makes material clear and only tests on her notes even though she says she tests from the book. her tests can be hard, but as long as you show up to class, listen, and take notes you should do fine. some tests and a pretty easy project are all she uses for a grade. i love her and her class! definitely take her",5.0,3.0,,
"I had her for lab and lecture over the summer and it was awesome! I was not looking forward to it at all, but she made class so interesting and made me want to learn.

"Towne is obviously very passionate about biology, which makes the class much more interesting. Attendance is mandatory, and he makes a point to tell you if you don't go to class, you will not do as well. Although he posts the powerpoints, he explains things in class that are not on them. The class is challenging, but not impossible to pass.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Every week he gives one or two online homework assignments that are very simple, they let you keep trying until you get 100%. He puts the power points from class online and as long as you read them you will do well, but make sure you go to class because he will mention things that aren't on the slides. Very easy, and he's super nice and patient.",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Very clear; cares about students understanding the material.  If  you're lazy, you're going to have a hard time.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Towne was excellent in Principles of Biology. He expects that you learn and understand the material, but it's really not that bad if you have a real interest in biology. Tests are very thorough. I wrote down practically every word he said and there were still a couple that seemed to come out of nowhere.  Great lab proctor as well.",4.0,4.0,,
"Dr. Towne (despite what other people have posted about his easiness) is a great professor and is very devoted to his classes. Principles of Biology was a piece of cake with him. He's extremely helpful and even handed out extra credit. Take good notes, show up to class, and do the occasional homework assignment, and you'll have an easy A. ",5.0,2.0,,
"Dr. Towne is a very good professor, however some times his lectures are hard to follow if biology is not your strong point. He is very willing to help his students to do well. I went to him a lot through-out the semester and he helped me so much. ",3.0,3.0, Mandatory,
"This class will be a challenge, more so if you do not have a study technique. The amount of content you need to know is a lot, so  understanding is key to memorizing what you need to know. The book and online tools really help so utilize them! He's an amazing teacher who's very eager to help students any way he can. I'd definitely take him again!",5.0,4.0,,
"Took him fall 2014 semester. You'll need to study and read much more than in other classes. In order to do well on his tests, you'll need to know the concepts inside and out, a basic understanding of the material on tests will get you no higher than a C- ( so if you're confused on something get help or be prepared to earn some disappointing grades)",3.5,5.0, Mandatory,
"He's a great professor but he is sometimes unclear on the point he is trying to get across. He's a hard grader. The tests killed that class for me. I did well in lab, the quizzes in class, and the homework, but I could NOT take the tests to save my grade. The studying saved my grade.",4.0,4.0,,
So awesome. Learned so much. So respectful even when you disagree.,5.0,4.0, Mandatory,
"A great prof in lecture, but very unhelpful in lab. Test material is straight from lecture. Expects you to already know exactly what to do in lab despite being a STUDENT.

"Biology.  Dr. Towne makes it enjoyable.  Yes, his tests are hard and lengthy, but they should be.  This course is for science majors only, and it is meant to be a challenge as compared to BIO 10.  He lays everything out at the start of the course, and if you go to his office hours, he will do everything that he can to help you.  Great guy.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory,

"Genetics is tough stuff, and while Dr. Towne has a bit of a stutter, he gets points across very well. You will ABSOLUTELY NEED to study outside of class, but he genuinely wants his students to succeed. Given the choice for lab instructors, take it with Towne. I made the mistake of taking lab with another professor and she did a poor job.",4.5,3.0,,
"Worked so hard for him. He is a great teacher, but very tough. Hsd trouble getting some help...a required course for me...but rough. Nice man...glad it is over. He talked more of Moravian than of Kutztown.",4.0,4.0,,
"Dr. Towne is a great prof. always helpful, but is a very tough grader.",4.5,4.0,,
Dr. Towne is a helpful and a dynamic professor. He makes a 100 level bio class fascinating and he is chalk-full of relevant material to even the non-bio major. People complain that grading is difficult and sometimes overly harsh - not the case at all! He simply is one of the few professers at Kutztown that doesn't stoop to inflating his grades.,4.5,3.0,,
"Kind of a hardass with grading.  Consistently results in at least half the class scoring under 75%, yet Towne always puts it on the students.  No review sheets to speak of.   Very knowledgeable, but not great at making sure his students succeed.",2.5,5.0,,
Makes you think!,3.5,5.0, Not Mandatory,

"Brilliant, but that brilliance is worthless because he has no skills as an educator.  Yells and berates students who speak out or disagree.  Cannot cover assigned material in given time.  You leave the class feeling belittled and unprepared for future work in the field.",1.5,5.0,,
Best Bible teacher at Harding,4.5,2.0,,

1) Take notes on everything. 2) Get a dictionary because he uses words no one knows the meaning of frequently.    3) You have to be organized.  4) He sometimes goes off on random stories that supposedly have to do with the topic.                    5) You may not learn alot about the subject material as much as just random facts about life.,3.5,3.0,,

A bit disorganized but still a great prof.",3.0,2.0, Mandatory,

She encourages you to NOT ask her Questions",1.0,4.0, Mandatory,

In-class iclicker quizzes do not produce marks unless you score very high in them.,2.5,5.0,,

King is terrible if you can get out of taking him please do. I don't know how so much evil can be in one person all his exams are memorization. If you can memorize about 200 slides per exam you can get an A. Do as much EC as possible you will need it!,2.0,4.0,,

Peggy is genuinely one of the best people I've ever met.

"Keep your own views out of science. or better yet, take the science out of social science, and call it social studies. The prof took it upon her to ensure, only what she wanted taught to the class was taught, many contradicting studies were ignored, and Socialism and Feminism is a VIEW not SCIENCE and thus should be kept out of University courses.",1.0,1.0, Mandatory, No
"INCREDIBLE prof. Truly a gem. She gave my class her personal phone number in case we needed help on understanding concepts. So passionate about her work and very involved with the students.

Zorzitto is the best of the three calculus professors I have had. His notes are very useful and his class progression is his own marble David.

Not a bad prof though.",3.5,1.0,,

lol you guys are so troll. his class average was like a 50. good prof though,4.5,5.0,,
"He could be great at teaching regular classes, but should not teach advanced classes. His approach to bellcurving is making the exams easy. His proofs contain far too many heuristics.

His lectures for History of Mathematics (CO 480) are very fun to attend.,4.5,2.0, Mandatory,
He is amazing. He does a history of math portion to his lectures and tries to get you to connect with your mathematical ancestors. He also has a world view and talks about things that are not math specific. His classes force you to think and question what you know of math and the world. I would take a course just to have him as a professor.,5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory,
One of the few professors I actually remember and I still consider a mentor. He shaped my view of mathematics and it is a shame that I got to know his approach closer to the end of my time at UW.

Something super easy can be made extremely difficult when he rushes through. Tough course, average prof.",3.5,4.0, Not Mandatory,
"Philip Scott is one of the best I have ever had in my many years of university. He is amazingly knowledgable, he is always willing to repeat and help his students understand.

"For a easy course like 1348, he is not the prof you want to have. He uses diffident symbols to show one thing whereas just one symbol could do it. When he teaches you it is like he is showing off his knowledge instead of really teaching you stuff. Worst man I've ever seen in my entire life. He actually can ruin your university life.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"If you really want to dive into theory, this is the course, and this is the dude. I wouldn't recommend him for a more computational course like MAT1341. He posts extra notes for you at 2am then bikes to 8:30 class and kills it: every week. Answers email seconds later, and you can stop by his office ANY Time. Fun to talk too as well.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory,
This proff is very clear in what he wants.  1. midterm a bit hard but still ace able 2. assignments aren't long or hard 3. all the notes are given 4. final very easy  He is a very good proff in explaining and all the people who complain just didn't attend class(even tho its mandatory).  ,4.0,1.0, Mandatory,
"Worst prof I've ever had. Had him for a year. Terrible teaching, uses the notes from other profs to post online and not his own so some terms and notations do not match. Absolutely useless for posting study material online, and what ever he does post is a day or two before the midterm or final and once again not his. Doesn't have a train of thought",1.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"If one was to explain something as simple as (ab), this prof. can for sure be counted on to make it as tedious as possible in his explanation. P.s. he loves giving history lessons. Should teach history instead. Math should be taught by those who can explain and help understand well, not by those who understand it alright for themselves.",3.0,4.0,,
"Probably my favorite professor there at Ottawa U. His lectures are extremely well thought out, and are very well presented. He posts as much information as one could want to help pass the course, and is always there to help. Found myself going over his notes more than the text book. Highly recommend to anyone in the Maths.  ",4.5,2.0, Not Mandatory,
"Phil Scott is a really nice prof and he is very supportive, tries to convey the information as clear as possible and makes sure students get the point before he moves on. He cares for his students and wants everyone to pass, his tests can be a little tricky but if you study you will definitely do well in the course.",3.5,3.0, Not Mandatory,
"It's a fun class. Scott is clearly in it to share what he loves (math) and the midterms are from the old exams. Final however was much more difficult (very long and no repeated questions from the old exams) but I am pretty sure he marked it lightly since it was so long. Oh: please don't take this course unless you are in math, physics, or CS. p l z",5.0,4.0,,
"In a nutshell, his lectures are extremely confusing. However he tries his best to help you and if you go to his office hours he's more than willing to help. Most of the class didn't understand a word he was saying and I was forced to use patrickjmt and MIT lectures to understand his material. Avoid if you can, if not, attend his office hours.",2.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"This guy is the epitome of a math professor! Loves what he does, cares about students, and that spills over into your enjoyment of the course. I enjoyed the history anecdotes too. Excellent prof!  My only complaint, possibly the worst board eraser ever! Can be challenging to read notes sometimes.  ",5.0,1.0,,
"This course was interesting. He is an enthusiastic lecturer and a nice guy. The assignments were brutal and his notes were sloppy and unorganized. His midterm & exam were okay, a lot of opportunity for bonus points but a lot of material you need to remember. Not my ideal math elective but could have been worse.",3.0,3.0,,
"The only downside about this prof was that he made the final exam extremely difficult. Hope he'll bell-curve the final exam grades like a lot of math profs do. Other than that, pretty great prof, fun to listen to, assignments/midterm reflect what was learned.",4.0,2.0,,
"Horrible prof. Can't speak French properly, so we can't understand what he's saying while we can't understand the subject matter! He heavily relies on his notes and the book, often neglecting to explain something in class, saying ""Look at my notes"" or ""Look at Hofstra's notes"". Does a poor job at making sure we understand. Homework's unrelated too.",1.0,5.0,,
"He's all over the place. Doesn't seem to know what he's talking about half the time because he jumps from one topic to the next. His mini-tests every week are fine and pretty easy to understand, then he assigns homework with absolutely nothing we have learnt on it expecting us to understand and actually do it. This class really makes me hate math..",2.0,4.0,,
"Engaging and animated lecturer; he is enthusiastic about the material and it's hard not to catch it as a student (if you've already some interest in math/logic).

"He knows his stuff, but likes to go off on tangents every now and again. His slides are derived from the textbook authors. So pay attention in class and you won't need the text book.

"You'll have to work hard, but it's worth it. He doesn't always give the clearest guidelines - I consider this a good thing. It leaves you room to explore and learn on your own, and he's usually good at spotting effort or lack thereof. He supports open source. :) He's somewhat set in his ideas, which is fine since he knows what he's talking about.",4.0,4.0,,
"Hard courses, hard prof, but very intelligent. He can be tempermental at times, and once accused myself and some friends of conspiring against him.

I believe Hymel did an amazing job with teaching stats. He gives reviews for the tests at least a week or so in advance and they are literally exactly what is on the test for each chapter. You have to go to class and pay attention though. You can't just skip and then read the book.,3.5,4.0, Mandatory,
Dr. Hymel is seriously amazing! Don't listen to people who says he's impossible.

Dr. Hymel is hard to follow at times but if you just READ & study the chapters for his test it is real simple. He uses his own TB so its pretty much verbatim.

Karen did a good job as my professor in my last semester speech class. I thought she had a tougher time dealing with some of our immature classmates than teaching the class.

You have to correctly apply what she has stated.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

Not willing to work with students AT ALL.",1.0,4.0,, No

I really have no idea how he is the chair of the department. I still do not know any basic concepts because he does not teach well. HE does not post videos walking through the PowerPoints so you have to look at it and teach yourself the math because he does not show you how the financial calculator works. Very rude if you try to email him as well.,1.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
Summer session with this dude is awful. only goes over few problems in his powerpoints which are nothing like quizzes and tests.

May be a prof but cant explain adequately,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No

"Didn't use text. Lectures and problem solving videos were my main source of studying. Best online class with ECU yet.

Great Professor! Has fun stories incorporated into his lectures and makes it easy to learn an otherwise difficult subject of tax.,5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Schisler presents this class in a very clear and easy to follow way. His lectures are a must and he is extremely clear on what material will be tested etc. The homework and lectures are critical to doing well on the tests. If you put the effort into this class you have no excuse for not doing well. He is the best accounting prof I have ever had,4.5,3.0, Not Mandatory,
"Took Dr S for ACCT 6241 during the summer.   It's a very fast paced, condensed class.  3 exams and 25 quizzes so you have to keep up.  His lectures are clear and to the point.  He gives great hints about what will be on the exams.  Watch the lectures, do the problems and you'll be fine.    His stories are funny! ",4.5,3.0,,

Dr. Schneider was one of the best teachers I've had at ECU. He teaches a pretty challenging class but he is a great professor! The class didn't do the best on the first test and he made sure to give us practice tests from there on out and everyone's grades improved tremendously. He is a genuinely good guy and a caring professor.,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes

He also gives great career and life advice and relates it to business and accounting.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Schneider is hands down the best professor I have had during my college career. He creates his own packet instead of a book. This packet will run you about 15 dollars.

He has a no technology policy in class.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes

"His HNRS colloquium was very easy and straight forward. Streitmatter is so funny. Also, make sure you read, because it's easy to avoid reading because there are only class discussions.

"Great professor for PSYC 1101. The class is lecture-heavy (as in ALL content is delivered through in-person lectures), and lectures are only spoken with occasional writing on the board.

"There really wasn't a boring lecture. 

Our grade was 3 tests and a final (25% each). This semester (unlike previous semesters) he decided that the grade distribution would have 15% of students get an A, which is really brutal for an intro humanities course.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

It's hard to study anything when it just bums you out...",1.5,5.0,,

Dr Kulhavy made this class unbearable. His slides had entire novels on them and he blew through them fast. We barely learned anything about landscape ecology. Instead he rambled on and on about drones which had nothing to do with the class. Overall this class was made to test our patience instead of teach us anything. It's easy but its not worth it,1.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, No
He is crazy as all get out but can be extremely funny. The class could never be hard but I took it as an honors class and it was awesome.

By far the best teacher ive had so far. He is very passionate and knows his stuff. TAKE HIM!!!!,5.0,3.0,,
"The best teacher I've ever had. Almost every single day in his American Lit course was a blast. His Hemingway unit is a model of perfect pedagogy--engaging, enjoyable, and enlightening. He grades tough, but by NO means is he trying to fail you. Intense and committed in class, but extremely laid back in his office hours. Take him. Now.",5.0,2.0,,

"She really grew on me. the first time i had her i thought she was okay, but the second time i found her very informative. when she is talking about subject matter she really knows she is very clear, organized, and even funny. Its easy to follow along and the readings are usually good. the tests seem daunting but she is a pretty generous grader.",5.0,2.0,,
I really liked Dr. Childers. She does talk to you like you are a child but what can you expect from someone who works with children a lot of the time? Her tests are essay tests that come mostly from information you learn in articles. It was sometimes intimidating to have discussions but I liked the class.,4.0,2.0,,
"Childers is alright. I'm being generous even then. Her lectures are tangental, most of class is student-directed, and she is EXTREMELY ambiguous as to what she wants on tests/assignment. Then during the test she wants the most miniscule details of everything covered in class despite ""only having to cover main ideas."" Ambiguity thy name is Childers.",2.0,4.0,,
"The lectures are a joke. Everything is based on the experiment readings that you do outside of class (or you're supposed to do). She is so nice and means well, but she talks to you like you're 3. All tests are essay and can be intense, if you don't read.",2.5,3.0,,

It is a reading heavy course with daily journal entries, but overall Dr Spener is a really laid back and fun professor. I enjoyed engaging in difficult conversations with him and would certainly take again.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I had Dr. Spener for Social Justice and he was an alright professor. The material was very interesting, but instead of judging papers or additions to the discussion based on how well you could support your view, he was looking mainly for you to agree with his thoughts. If you parrot his analyses back to him in your papers, you will do fine.",3.0,2.0, Mandatory, No
"I took him for Globalization and Social Change. Even though I had never taken a sociology class previously, he was super encouraging and cared a lot about the students and their success. Was very passionate about the lecture material and discussions which were super interesting. Easy to fall behind though, so stay on top of reading.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Tough but fair. The class is entirely essay/short answer & he's picky about word choice but he also gives very specific feedback so it's easy to learn dos and don'ts. A lot of reading but you can mostly figure out content from the lecture tbh. Only 2 exams, short weekly assignments, & 1 paper. He offers a lot of extra credit & review sessions.",4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Spener is an extremely tough grader, he has unrealistic expectations about his students; which could become real ones if he would provide clear grading criteria, but no one knows what he is looking for and suddenly you get points deducted for extremely minor things, which is very unfair. He knows what he teaches but he is very disorganized.",2.0,5.0, Mandatory, No

",4.5,5.0,,
"Really boring lectures with information that seems obvious. Participation is a must, but speaking up often leaves you feeling like you just asked the dumbest question in the world.

"Unfortunately, this particular prof thinks talking about taking his shirt off at the commune and selling sprouts out of a radio flyer wagon is enough to negate his horribly repetitive slide shows from the 1980s. If i see RACE the power of an illusion one more time i will hang myself!",3.5,5.0,,
"This man is my nemesis. I do not like the way he teaches, grades, or talks. He basically drives me crazy. Every day i had his class i wanted to kill myself.

ugh,1.5,3.0,,
"Very intelligent & has interesting life experiences. Staunch in his political views & lets politics muddle teaching (this is coming from a liberal!)

Smart is smart. There is a lot of reading so be prepared to pick it apart for the info he will put on the tests. Tests are super long but I felt like the geography tests were a breeze. Study and ask questions: you'll do great!,4.0,4.0,,
"There are no essays in his classes. Instead, he has geography quizzes, history tests, and a research paper. The tests are curved and include material that you must read in your textbook (but are us. on the study guide). He tells you exactly what will be on the geography quizzes.

Lectures are interesting- he tells them like a story and makes connections between material and current events to make it seem more relevant.  Tests weren't too difficult if you studied. Really enjoyed the class and would recommend it to anyone.",4.5,3.0,,
"Smart's a fairly likeable character, but though his lectures are interesting, you can't take the best of notes from the way he gives you all the info. Know geography, he implements it in each class and there are tests over it.  Read all the readings or you're basically screwed on the midterm and final. Covers lots of info, make sure you know it.",4.5,3.0,,

This is a stress free class!",5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Personally, I am in love with Dr. Graves (my homie Bill), he is honestly one of the best professors I have had so far in college.

He makes his lectures very easygoing as well.",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Such an easy class and overall chill guy.  There was a textbook, but all info you need is covered in the lectures.  Never bought it and have a high A in the class.

10/10 would recommend. ,5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

He was super funny and didn't take himself super seriously; Respects his students and doesn't talk down. The material was really interesting and I never thought I'd like a Geography class. You need to watch the lectures/go to class to pass the tests. I didn't use/need the textbook. Take good notes!,5.0,2.0,, Yes
Dr. Graves is really chill. The class was asynchronous and quizzes were easy and short. I got the textbook and I wish I didn't because he teaches everything you need to know in the lectures. Super easy-going. Take his class!,5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Bill Graves is a wonderful professor - possibly the best I've ever had. Hilarious, informative, and lectures terms in a way you can remember, his lessons will 100% carry on to you after you finish his class.

"Professor Graves is a really chill, down-to-earth man. Personally, I thought the material was interesting. Ngl tho, his lectures are long. Attendance isnt mandatory but you should definitely go since he does do some pollev questions and he does not post his lectures online. The hw assignments were just readings. Overall, I thought it was an easy A",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Good professor and all around cool guy. Not overly strict with rules, grades tests (which aren't terribly difficult and are all multiple choice) on a curve, intermittent in-class quizzes through a polling app, and a relatively easy final project all make his class a home run. He wants you to get an A.",5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Bill was a great professor for GEOG 1101. I highly recommend you take him for this class. He makes lectures very interesting and has a great sense of humor. He is also very passionate for what he is teaching.,5.0,2.0,, Yes
"While attendance is not mandatory, he does not post the key information from the powerpoints. The lectures are very interesting. Write down all of the main ideas and some examples.

"Worst English Teacher ever!!! If you are not an English person, do not take this class. The professor takes it way too seriously for a core class.

Expect a minimum of 2 hours of homework for every class.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No

"Professor Jones was amazing. Quirky and hysterical. He assigned 3 essays, and broke down each of them to the point of having them almost written in class.

There can't be a better freshman English professor than Jones.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Professor Jones was awesome. He is very clear about what you can do to succeed in his class. You don't NEED the book he assigns & he always attaches an article version online. We had to write mini essays about texts we read. Essays are clear but require a lot of work. His writing conferences are SO helpful- he breaks down the essay and gives advice,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"When choosing my classes for the spring semester, I took into account reviews from this website. I read reviews of both praise and admonishment.

"Professor Jones is a great teacher, but confusing in what he says sometimes. Sometimes, it's not clear what he wants, but he is very helpful in conferences and helps you with your essays. You use the textbooks A LOT and he tries to get you to think on a deeper level.",4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Prof Jones is a really nice person. He has a great personality, but that is not always enough. You can tell he is an intelligent person, but his assignments are not clear at all.

"Prof. Jones is a cool dude. He is the head of the English department and not going to lie... is a tough grader.

"Well this was my least favorite class out of the semester. He gives a lot of unnecessary and unrealistic work pertaining to the material.

Nice guy, but Please avoid this professor.",1.5,4.0,,

He helped me VASTLY with all of my papers because he assigns a lot of rough drafts, but overall you become a better writer cause of it",5.0,2.0,,
Professor Jones is a very strict grader and gives tons of work throughout the semester.  He wants you to become like a profession writer or something.  All his work is due at 9am in the morning in blackboard.  The only good thing is that it made me a better writer but the class was sometimes boring and challenging.,2.5,4.0,,

But he does curve if needed.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Going to office hours is definitely a great idea for this class. You're assigned weekly reading and it is super important you read and understand the text before coming to class.

No one (including TAs) have any clue what's going on.",3.5,5.0, Mandatory,

I took several classes from Bruce about 10 years ago. I have to say that he was one of the best teachers I have encountered in my academic career. Thanks Dr.Roberts!,4.5,5.0,,

"Great Professor! Made what could have been boring material pretty interesting. I learned a lot in this class. He was always available if you had questions and also graded on a scale. I got like a 79 and an 85 on his tests and aced them both. Great teacher, take his class!",5.0,2.0,,
If you have to take ECO101J definately take it with Roberts!  He explains everything very clearly and in a way so that you're not just spitting back information.  You actually learn about economics and you're able to hold an intelligent conversation afterward.  He gives homework that is actually ON the exams so it's not just busywork.,4.5,5.0,,

"Dr. O'Brien was so-so.  She mentioned many times she does not have much time because she teaches so many classes and other students.

Highly recommend.,4.0,4.0,,

Lexa is great. Organizational communication was not my concentration area but she  opened my eyes to how corporate communication is structured. Assignments are relevant: four 3-4pg papers and a 15-20 pg. Lit review.  The only bad thing is that she can be a little late posting readings- that's tough for full time workers with limited free time.,4.5,2.0,,
very sweet professor and extremely helpful. The course was very dry and too many readings. Hopefully you'll have her grade ur papers rather rather than locke. midterm was 2 papers and final 3 papers. the work in this class was too much for a scholarship i think,4.5,3.0,,

"It is unlike other courses, he allows you to question all the information given without the fear of being politically correct because the past is often discussed.

I would recommend taking another lab science just so you don't have her.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No

"Dr Kelley is my advisor, so when I took ERS 101 which she taught she took special attention to my other first year majors and I in the program.

Alice K is great... as long as you agree with her political views.

I really like Dr. Kelley as a person! She's super friendly! Her lectures cover basically everything u learned in the textbook so they're not essential but I liked to go for participation credit.

"Professor Pabel has a reputation as a tough marker but to be honest, it felt pretty in line with what a third year course should be like.

"Dr. Pabel makes a somewhat dry (and very info-heavy) topic (the Reformation) engaging, and assigns various types of papers which keeps it from getting repetitive. He actually uses Canvas(!), gave me technical and historical feedback on my papers, and provides a great syllabus. Really available for asking questions or discussing ideas.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"It was an absolute pleasure to be Pabel's student. His lectures are captivating; instead of giving you boring details about history, he delved into the culture and mentality of early modern Europeans. His marking is on the harder side, but his comments are really helpful to improve on future assignments. I plan on taking further classes with him.",5.0,3.0,, Yes
"Honestly the worst prof at SFU, don not take this course, I needed one history credit to graduate as a 4.0 student and he ruined it all. I do not understand how he is employed. All he wants is students to fail. I can get over the reading and homework, but honestly just help people succeed not fail! On a power trip and just plain rude and unhelpful",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
Does not grade at an undergraduate level. I got 15% lower grade in his class than my next lowest class grade. Gives you no room for your own ideas on papers.

One of my favourite POL classes so far. Gives great additional feedback on assessments when you request it. You must work hard for your grade but I believe Prof Heard is a fair grader over all.

SO MUCH READING for being tested on such specific things. DO NOT.",1.0,4.0,, No
"Heard is a really funny professor who definitely knows a lot about what he's teaching. Exams are really fair, and he records lectures and puts them online if you're sick.

Overall, a good prof for POL221!",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Amazing lectures. Really funny guy. Very knowledgeable and definitely prominent in his field. He does grade fairly difficultly as others have noted and the paper is pretty long but not too bad. His tests aren't too bad; all written from a pool that you can choose from.  He records his lectures  Audio/Video/Slides which is nice.,5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Being a 4th year student, I did not expect this class to be as difficult as Dr. Heard made it out to be. He is a very strict marker for a first-year introductory course.

He is a difficult marker but gives clear and constructive feedback. Very willing to compromise and understanding of students need. He is willing to give a day or two extensions for the essays even if your reasoning is procrastination. Flexible with zoom meetings to help students analyze the harder texts.,4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
I have never had a professor who cared so much about his students doing well. We had a small class size so that may be why. He was there to make sure you did well and we did some really interesting things. He would help with assignments and was always accessible through email and gave good feedback. The assignments are all straightforward.,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
He said the course was going to be about Britian at War. I took the class for my interest in Britian but all we talked about was some diarist from the 1940's. By far one of the worst classes I've taken. Taking notes is hard because mid lecture he will jump from topic to topic without distinction and be prepared for TONS of reading.,1.0,4.0,, No
OH MY GOD! I took this class as an elective and it was the worst decision of my life! DO NOT TAKE AS AN ELECTIVE! Crazy amount of readings in old english!!!!! And its so subjective to the TA how well your writing assignments are. It was not worth an elective.,4.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Dr. Craig is passionate and cares about his students. However, his lectures are all over the place and have no structure at all.

Take if you have time to read.",3.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Dr. Craig was awesome. He can go off on tangents but it's all within the context of history. He is willing to give feedback on where one can improve in writing.

"I was really excited to take this class. Sadly, Dr. Craig's reliance on dull textbooks (a hundred pages of reading a week no less), ludicrous lectures and an unrealistic level of expectation on students ruined this class for me. This is one to avoid, it will not only bring down your GPA but give you a migraine in the process.",2.0,5.0,,
"This course uses some of the worst textbooks I've ever used, and Craig admits that you're going to have to do your own outside research to really grasp the concepts in class.

he gave use way to much reading you'd have to read like 50 pages for the class and another 50-100 for his tutorial hes a nice guy in person but goes of track all the time in lecture and tutorial aviod this class take it if you have too craig skipped like 500 years of history and went righ to the 16-17th century cuz thats what hes interested in,2.0,5.0,,
"Unfortunately, this is one of the rare cases where the professor knows too much about his subject.

Confusing lectures as he likes to combine lectures and teach half of one lecture and half of another. Usually lets us leave early though. A lot of reading to do to be able to understand the lectures.

She was great and i would have to disagree with the person that said a 4.0 wasnt possible becuase i had a 4.0.. I would recomend her to anyone.  She was always there to help and she made u feel like you were some what importent.. Just talk to her..,5.0,2.0,,
"She was an ok teacher, really easn't that interesting but overall was an easy class.",3.0,2.0,,
"I had to take this class for my teaching certification.  It is a waste of time--as a high school English teacher, this grammar is not the material I need to know nor that my students need to know.  I do not understand why this class is still required for English teachers when it is non-standard grammar, i.e., not what we would teach students.",1.0,3.0, Mandatory,
"The class is difficult because he is teaching from his own material. You can screw up very easily if you are not on top of everything from the get go. On the other hand, he offers many opportunities to boost your grade. Not for those unwilling to work hard and actually attend class. Absences resulted in points deducted from final grade.",2.0,3.0,,
"He made us work in pairs on the final project.  The day it was due, my partner didn't show up.  I had gone to him earlier since I could never get in contact w/her.  All he said was, ""This is a group project.  That means two.""  He gave both of us an F for the project even though I had talked to him about my problem and was doing well in the class!",1.5,2.0,,

the class content is fun but he is one of the rudest professors,2.0,4.0,,
"Maybe because it was a summer class, he seemed to show no enthusiasm for, or interest in, teaching this class.  He seemed bored with the material.  Because of this, the class was excruciatingly boring.  He's also kind of an ass.  I would NOT recommend this professor to anyone.",2.0,2.0,,
"English Grammar w/ Underwood was one of my worst undergraduate experiences at UT. He is a nice guy, but forces you to learn his theory of grammar which does not work! (That is why your text is his unpublished manuscript.) Pure torture.",2.0,3.0,,
He is very helpful.  He doesn't believe in grading according to right and wrong answers but on effort.  He comes off like a tyrant but is really very easy going.,5.0,3.0,,
"Dr. Underwood was the first professor I ever had. He made the class feel comfortable about sharing their writing, and worked hard to praise students who made a conscientious effort. Freshman composition was a scary class for me, and he made it feel safe.",5.0,3.0,,
"Dr. Federico is such a sweet and caring person. She cares about her students a lot and all she wants to do is share her love of poetry with anyone she can. The class is fun and not too hard. Participation is highly encouraged to get the most out of the class, but Dr. Federico is super easy to talk to. I highly recommend this class and this prof!",5.0,2.0,, Yes
"Professor Federico loves poetry and cares a lot about her students. There were only a couple of short essays and a project for the whole semester, and she is always happy to talk about poetry or assignments outside of class. She grades fairly as long as you put in effort. One of my favorite professors so far at JMU.",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Federico is fantastic. She's passionate about poetry, interested in her student's opinions, and challenges you without making the class difficult to pass. She always leaves good feedback on your papers, and grades according to how hard you work. She values students who show up and participate.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Federico is one of the kindest and sweetest people ever. She really loves what she teaches and really loves and cares about her students. A lot of the class is group discussion but it is so good and so worth it. Showing up to class is genuinely a fun time and would recommend this class and this prof to anyone and everyone.,5.0,1.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Federico is great. A little strict, but friendly and knowledgeable. You either have to know what you read or be good at pretending. Two short papers, a partner presentation, a midterm and a final. Not bad at all. You need to bring the textbook with you to each class, which is a pain, but otherwise no complaints.",4.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Attendance isn't mandatory but she goes over the readings a lot in class and the notes you take are everything that's on the exams. The tests aren't too bad, mostly multiple choice and she drops the lowest. There's 3 short papers that she grades without a rubric, but if you go to her office hours she'll go over it with you. Not bad for a gen-ed!",3.0,3.0,, Yes
"Professor Federico is very sweet & knowledgeable about the topics covered in class, but the class is difficult for someone who doesn't know a lot about literature especially for being a GenEd. There were three papers that there was no rubric for & never got handed back to us. Four exams but the lowest score will be dropped. She's also disorganized",2.0,3.0, Mandatory, No
"One of my favorite courses, not because of the material but her! A super caring professor, always accessible to meet with you. I was not super interested in the course, but her lectures were extremely inspiring! I am a writing major and she definitely improved my writing! Not a difficult course but make the best of it!!",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Professor Federico is a really sweet lady & she's willing to work with you & help you out if you go to her office hours. The readings & discussions could be tedious at times, but it was one of my more relaxing courses. I would take another course with her if I needed another English!",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I took her for ENG299 and she was easily my least favorite teacher that semester. Her class is so boring, and you basically just sit there and listen to your classmates' interpretations of literature. Terrible. You learn nothing in class, and the reading is so boring. Take a different class if you're in it for the reading.",2.0,3.0, Mandatory, No
"Dr. Federico was an average prof, not too bad/not too great. Class was boring imo for the most part but some discussions were interesting. 4 papers, 1 presentation. If there's a better option I'd suggest that but this was honestly fine and she's very nice",3.0,3.0, Mandatory, No
"I love Dr. Federico! I took her for an upper level English class and I just wish I had met her sooner. She's so genuinely sweet. A tough grader, but I sincerely loved going to her class. Participate and let yourself enjoy it. She's great",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"A lot of papers and reading. Dr. Federico is a nice person, but we didn't learn a lot about how to write, which was the point of the course. She also did not put in grades, even when the course ended, so I did not find out what I received on assignments, which was frustrating. Work hard and a B is an achievable grade.",3.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes

"OK listen. This class is not hard at all if you just show up and take notes on what she says. I never read any of the books, just summaries, and I will end up with a B. she drops your lowest test score. Just sit in the front and take notes and you'll be absolutely fine. You get out what you put in. Also, I loathe english and reading.",3.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
It's British Literature aka the class and readings are unbearably boring. Unless you're an english major please avoid this class.,2.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
This class is pretty difficult. You have to read A LOT which is to be expected but sucks. The grading criteria for the 2 extremely short papers you write are clear. The papers are really easy so don't freak out over them. You will definetly get the grade you work for though.,3.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
"This was my second class with Federico. She is a great teacher, but she does a lot better with a smaller class size. I would not recommend to take her in a big lecture she can get a little off track and boring. She is a sweet lady though and really cares about the students. If you have a chance to take her smaller class I recommend it!",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"She is a great professor who gives great lectures. The class is easy, but the tests are on material that she talks about in class, so you have to go, pay attention, and take notes. Study notes before the test, write the paper the day it's due, you'll still get an A.",3.5,2.0, Not Mandatory,
"Dr. Federico is the sweetest lady. Everything on the tests come from her lectures, so as long as you read and go to class, the tests are pretty straightforward. One test out of the four is dropped and there are 3 short papers. 10/10 would recommend her class.",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory,
Rico is one of the funniest people I've ever met and a great guy. He truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. You do have to do the work to get a good grade but it's easy. The only thing is his wording on assignments can be confusing but gets easier to understand over time.,5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"While he is really friendly and easily accessible for outside help, he can be difficult to follow in class. Rico will go on tangents about off topic things or not clearly explain certain concepts. He also required a textbook we did not use. Overall is a great person but can be confusing as a professor. ",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Rico is an amazing professor and makes Stat really easy to learn!I have never taken a stats class before and taking him was the best decision!Although he requires a book, we only used it once and all other handouts were on moodle. Quizzes, exams are easy and study guides are given. He helps with the Trabajitos and they prepare you for the exam/quiz",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Rico is the best! Always singing pop songs and can go on hilarious tangents. He drops 1 or 2 trabajitos (weekly assignments very easy & can work with a partner) of the 5. Provides many opportunities to get bonus points like turning in on paper or early. There are 3 exams that are simple and he provides study guides. Cares about DSS.  Made stats fun,5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"I didn't like the way he taught, but it is helpful for studying. He prints papers with everything you need to know and goes over it for 50 minutes. If you study the material you'll be just fine and he gives you SO MANY STUDY MATERIALS. Tests/quizzes are EZ if you can deal with the mostly pointless lectures. very helpful after class too",4.0,2.0, Not Mandatory,
"I love rico! He is really willing to help you and wants you to succeed. As long as you study the quizzes and homeworks you will be fine on the exam. He gives you a number of homeworks throughout the semester but drops the two lowest ones, same goes for quizzes. Such a character and will talk your ear off about bingo or music. Really caring.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Rico is one of the best professors I've had. He makes stats easy to understand and is extremely willing to meet with you outside of class. Sometimes he gets lost in his tangents, but he always finds his way back. He tells you to buy a textbook but you don't need it, better off using his practice problems.",5.0,1.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Auer, or Rico as his students call him, is one of the greatest professors at Loyola. If you're not great at math, DON'T WORRY! There are endless opportunities to succeed in his class. His lectures are fun and light hearted; sometimes you forget you're learning math! Would definitely take from him again.",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Auer was one of the best professors I've had so far. If you're not good at math or just looking for an easy A for the requirement I would 100% recommend him. He's really goofy and super nice and grades super easy. He posts everything you need and truly tries his best to let everyone get a good grade.,5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
He made statistics into something that was fun and accessible for everyone. He had clear grading criteria and was really great at breaking down and explaining complex math subjects. He wants students to do well and would often explain something in different ways to make sure everyone got the concept,5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Auer is my favorite teacher! If you don't like teachers who tend to go off-topic he may not be for you, he's a bit quirky but I had the best time taking his class. He gives 3 tests and 4 quizzes but he only counts your 2 best quizzes. He gives projects that are very straightforward. He goes at a pretty slow pace and makes the class very easy!",5.0,1.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Ricky was the best professor I ever had. He was very passionate about his job and was always there when you needed him. He stays late throughout the week, so even if it's super late, he's probably in his office. He always offers extra help sessions before quizzes and exams. He is also full of jokes. Be sure to ask about Jeremy if you take him",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"""Wacky"" is definitely the right word to describe Auer. Two pieces of advice: Go to his office at least once, and establish a relationship with him. Get to know him and you'll hear some wild stories, and may even see your name in your next exam!",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Wackiest guy ever but thats what makes class fun and interesting. He genuinely takes the time out to get to know all his students and assist in any way possible! 4 quizzes drop the 2 lowest grades, 4 projects, 2 midterms and final, seems like a lot but all were unimaginably easy. BE READY TO LAUGH!",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Auer is the best! At first I was a little skeptical because he was a little goofy, but he ended up being a great teacher and made math fun- who knew? There wasn't much work outside of class at all and he was a very fair grader. He takes time to know all of his students and their interests and has so many great stories. Would 100% recommend him!",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Auer is the wackiest professor I have ever had, but he really knows his stuff, teaches it well, and is ALWAYS willing to help you.  There are 4 quizzes and he drops your 2 lowest grades, and he gives extra credit if you hand projects in early.  The class is super easy and you don't really have to pay attention in class.  Take this class!",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Very clear teacher, makes stat easy to understand. Very positive, extremely fair grader, makes sure you get lots of practice. 6 quizzes but he only keeps the top 3 scores. I LOVE HIM. He loves statistics ",4.5,2.0, Not Mandatory,
I LOVED him! Great teacher! Makes the class so much fun and is just such a goofy guy (in a good way). You will definitely be laughing during his class. He also drops some of the quiz grades and you are allowed to do homework with a partner and put both names on it. Knows every persons name which is nice. I would love to take him again if I could.,5.0,1.0, Mandatory,
Truly a great teacher. Not a harsh grader and teaches you everything he expects you to know. ,4.5,3.0, Mandatory,
"Dr. Auer is a great guy, cares about his students, and really wants them to succeed. However, he can be very unclear in his lectures and occasionally goes on tangents. He makes it relatively easy to get a good grade. I would highly reccommend him if you have already taken statistics in high school or have a good background on it.",2.0,2.0, Mandatory,
"Dr. Devenyi is very organized and always gives exams back the next class, he outlines what sections you need to read and gives worksheets to practice.This is a 300 level course, so it is not meant to be easy, but I feel like he gives a lot opportunities to do well, especially by dropping an exam and curves. ",4.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"He gives good opportunities to do well. He drops an exam and curves all exams, the curves are percentages of your score,the higher you score,the better the curve so it could knock you form a high C to a B or a high B to an A. However,you have to WORK for your grade in this class. Read the textbook and do the problems he assigns and you can do well",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Devenji is a very smart man but can be so smart that he can't ""dumb"" it down for people who haven't taken chemistry since highschool. Grades based entirely off exams and be prepared to drop if you don't pass the first two. Also don't count on the curve to save your exam grade. Very tough and picky grader, still not sure his grading system.",1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"Tough grading, but what bugged me the most was the test curves. He made it very obvious when posting all grades (by student ID) and the top scoring test as a key. For example, he would add +15 to the top grade, meanwhile my low grade test was given a +2. Very frustrating as I studied hours for his tests and couldn't get the hang of it.",1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Dr. Devenyi is a great person, but an iffy professor. Attendance is not mandatory, but if you skip, you might as well drop it. All his grades are based on exams (usually 5 of them) and the lab (30%). Get ready to go through the textbook. He assigns a bundle of problems, again not mandatory, but you won't pass if you don't practice. Very hard class!",3.0,5.0, Mandatory, Yes
"For Lab, he is very straight forward. As you enter the class, you take a quiz 90% last weeks lab and 10% this weeks lab. Then he goes over the lab and you head to the Lab. During the experiment, he will walk around an answer any uncertainties you have. His English is also very well. Reading the lab procedure before lab will help a lot!",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
When people say that he is a difficult professor they speak the truth. Be prepared to work for the grade you need. He may come off as arrogant but he is actually really nice and helpful when you need it. I would register for future classes he will teach without hesitation.,4.0,5.0, Mandatory, Yes
"While Organic Chemistry is a terrible subject, Dr. Devenyi just makes it worse. Very tough tests and he has no mercy when grading. He will count something wrong on one person's test, but count it right on another. He flies through the material and goes over lecture time almost every class period. He does not care if his students pass or not.",2.0,5.0, Not Mandatory,
"Organic chemistry is a subject I have struggled with understanding. Dr. Devenyi is very knowledgable on the subject, however, he rapidly speeds through the material making it difficult to fully grasp the concept. If seeking additional help, he will answer specific questions concerning a problem, but will not further explain a specific topic.",2.0,5.0, Not Mandatory,
"Dr. Devenyi is awesome! His exams and homework assignments are tough, but he's always willing to help you if you ask. I highly recommend doing the practice problems and going to his office hours to ask questions about them. Make sure he knows who you are and get a good rapport with him. His class is not an easy A, but it's possible to make an A.",4.5,4.0, Not Mandatory,
"Very difficult course, speech barrier is there from his European background, however he speaks English well.  Homework will confuse you almost every time, example are much simpler than roughly half of assigned problems.  However he gives good feedback and will work with you if you ask.  Overall a good man to learn from if you love chemistry.",2.5,5.0, Mandatory,
"Although an A is not going to be cake to earn like in many other classes, it is possible with determination. Just read the book and do the problems in it, and you will do just fine in his class. He is a fantastic teacher who really knows his stuff. He is intimidating at first, but once you go and talk to him, he will gladly help you out.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory,
"Dr. Devenyi was overall a good professor. His accent takes a little getting used to. He teaches very quickly so if you skip class, you will miss a good bit of information. If you're looking for an easy A, take someone else. Expect to be challenged. Would take him again though. ",3.5,4.0,,
"Toughest teacher I've ever had!!! He  is super picky when grading tests! He's funny and a good man, but as a teacher I wouldn't suggest him unless you're amazing at teaching yourself the material. He does offer help, BUT even with extra help he teaches in a higher level than the Course. ",2.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"Dr. Devenyi is a very very smart man. This course is very difficult. He is also very rude, though. He isn't willing to work with you if you miss any assignment for any reason. My mother passed away close to the end of the semester and I missed a test and two labs. He said that test could be my ""drop grade"" and gave no other option. Not helpful!",3.0,5.0, Not Mandatory,
Absolutely terrible. Don't do it. I don't care what you think. ,1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory,
"Dr. Devenyi is a wonderful professor! He loves the subject, he's brilliant, and he's more than willing to help if you just ask.

Real sweet lady. Although her class is mandatory all of the homework is due the night before the test on the internet. You can also check your homework and it gives you the correct answers and shows examples for you. If you due the short study guide the test is the exact same just different numbers. Would definitly recommend.,4.5,2.0,,
One of the worst math teachers I've ever had.  I have taken alot of maths and this one was bad.  The online homework is absolutely ridiculous.  The quizzes will keep you in the math lab for hours on end.  Save yourself the pity and do not take this woman.  She is sweet but she is not a very good teacher.,1.5,4.0,,

"Good teacher, posts the notes she takes in class on blackboard, so instead of scribbling the notes down, you can watch her work the problems and then download the notes later. Gives alot of online quizzes which you can easily make 100 on. Tests aren't terrible, but you definitely have to know all the material she goes over in class. Very helpful.",5.0,2.0,,

"I love Mrs. Gathers. She is a little older but she knows her stuff and she knows how to teach it. She gives you lots of chances to do well in her class.

"she is a nice lady but this is a very hard class and i got no help.  i went every class, did all my homework, quizzes, and tests and still needed one or two ponits to pass.  she did not give them to me as i had hoped so if you try and just fail by alittle bit don't think you will get help.",2.0,5.0,,
"Mrs. Gathers was an okay teacher. She explains how to do things very nicely. The only problem I had with her was that she teaches way too fast, trying to cover as much material as she can before class is over, and I think I would have learned better if she worked at a slower pace. Overall, she was a good teacher, very nice, and sometimes sarcastic.",3.5,4.0,,
"Mrs. Gathers is a sweet lady, I like her personally. The class is a little hard, but she tries to help you as much as she can with study guides and the quiz grades can really help you.

One of the best professors I have ever had. He is extremely knowledgeable about his subject. Class is always interesting. I have learned so much and become a much better writer.

I took her Statistics class at night. I absolutely hate math but if you do the online homework and come to class that really boots your grade.

"Gibson is tough. And he'll push you. If he isn't, he'll find a way. But he's not sinister. He loves geology, but he also loves to see students achieve something. So while he could do standard teaching styles, he'll throw a wrench in to make you discover something, whether about academics or yourself. If you want to see your true strength, take him.",5.0,4.0,, Yes
Gibson really made a difficult class very understandable. He likes to crack jokes during lectures. There's outlines for the notes so you don't have to write everything he says. Lab was really fun if you actually study to understand the material. Please believe him when he says that the first 3 weeks of lab suck and you just have to get through it.,5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes

Hollis wasnt the best teacher I have had but not the worse. She was okay. This class you have to actually put a little effort into. If you're looking for an easy A I wouldnt suggest her.

"Highly do not recommend this class. She makes a syllabus but by the third week, we were way off schedule, and no revised syllabus was provided. She is so incredibly rude and hateful.

He is such a wonderful teacher. Everyone should take his class!!!!!,5.0,1.0,,
super nice guy,5.0,2.0,,
"We only had to do 4 essays for this class. No quizzes, tests, or discussions. Which is great if youre good at papers & not great if youre not. My mother died & she did give me an extension on that paper, but the sympathy stopped after that. I came down with the stomach virus near the due date of the last essay & she still gave me an F on it.",1.0,5.0,, No
I took a film class with Dr. Franks. The classes met twice a week with one meeting being about three hours long and other being 1.5hrs. Dr. Franks repeatedly got an attitude and was rude to the student that had to slip out for a restroom break during the 3 hour class. I heard the student multiple times explaining her bladder disorder to Dr. Franks.,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
She gives no clear explanation on what is expected. If you arent an English major you arent going to enjoy her class at all. I took this as a winter term so I knew it was going to be a heavy work load but she didnt clarify what was wrong about a paper and you basically had to guess what her prompt was asking for.,1.0,4.0,, No
Very helpful teacher. Responds to email same day. Let me turn in a paper early for feedback. Clear expectations.,5.0,4.0,, Yes
"She gives no explanation for the reason you got the grade you receive, no matter what you do its not good enough for her. Silly Personal Comments on your work. To much reading and to many papers",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
Dr Franks was a great choice for Italian Cinema. She lived there and told us many stories about the people and customs. Discussion was definitely lively both during and after the screenings. There were many short assignments so you get a chance to improve your grade.,5.0,3.0,, Yes
"Dr. Franks is very knowledgeable about film directors. She is passionate about us learning how filmmaking works. Be prepared to participate every day, and don't forget to watch the films. You can't fake your way because she knows the films so well. The best thing is you can rewrite your papers.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Unique seminar style of class requires you to be prepared with questions and answers every day. That said, it also made me do my reading and think hard about it. If you care about literature, you'll love the discussions. If you are only doing this course to fulfill a requirement, and you don't like to read, you won't be happy in ENG2030.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"if you like to read, this is the course for you. 2 papers and 4 discussion boards, not hard. grading is easy. i wrote a mediocre paper and got a B.",5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"I love Dr. Franks! She is intelligent, cares that we learn, and very knowledgeable. In World Lit we covered, literally, the world! It was very interesting to read stories from just about every part of the planet. Her comments on papers really do help you if you take time to read them and apply them to your next homework.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
One of the most frustrating experience of my college career. There was no justification for her grading beyond silly personal comments. The feedback she gives only insight into her egotistical personalty which you soon learn to placate. She expects you to read her mind and identify with whatever critical perspective of the LONG 3x weekly readings.,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
Sorta enjoyable. 30-60 pages of reading every class. Every absence or missed reading is a takeaway from your grade. Professor is nice but more concerned with her own situation and opinions. You cannot challenge her knowledge or conclusions. Grades consist of attendance and very few papers. Not the best choice of a teacher for 2030,3.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"Dr Franks uses a seminar style of teaching in Honors which means we all say something every day, if she calls on us. This made me prepare my homework more than I ever have before. This requires time but makes the discussion super thoughtful and interesting. Since it is World Lit, they range from philosophy to psychology to history, including lit.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Only 6 assignments: 4 discussions and 2 papers. She is a harsh grader, but prompts can be vague. Each assignment has a different book associated with it and she gives 2 weeks per discussion and 3 per paper. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE! You will struggle if you wait until the last minute to do your readings. Some summaries can be found online but not all.",2.0,4.0,, No
"Dr. Franks requires that you read six books and you have an assignment for each one. (Four discussions and two essays) If you don't do well on the first essay, the best you can do in the class is a 65. She has unclear grading criteria, is extremely harsh in telling you how wrong you are, and is impossible to reach outside of her office hours.",1.0,4.0,, No
"She does not tell you what she wants in a paper or discussion question, and then crucifies you for not knowing. It's her way or the highway. She refuses to work with you if you hold a different opinion from her. She expects you to know everything already, and to be able to analyze like that's all that keeps you alive. Do not take her if you can.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
She has two papers and if you do bad on them don't even bother with the discussions because you have already failed her class.,1.0,5.0,, No
"Dr Franks made Brit Lit II a lot more interesting than I thought it could ever be.  She makes you think about how the books and the history of the time period match up.  Discussions can get interesting.  Definitely prepare your homework before class, and you'll do fine.  She grades easy on the participation and gives lots of feedback on papers.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory,
"She's not a bad teacher. She's passionate about British Literature, & she  gives good feedback. However, if you are not one of her favorites, prepare to be graded harder, be humiliated in class, and for her to pick you for every class discussion. She's not fair with her grading of class discussion. She's very unfair to those who do not play along.",2.5,5.0, Mandatory,
I love Dr. Franks! She is quirky and relatable and very intelligent. She wants you to work for your grade and is available for good feedback. She is very passionate about her subject. I've had her for film class as well and she is so knowledgeable! Do yourself a favor and take her class if you are remotely interested in literature or film.,5.0,3.0,,
"I know Dr. Schiller is known as ""the gpa killer"" but that is the main reason I chose him. To me, that meant he taught the subject with the expectation that you will LEARN. I don't know about you but I don't want a nurse or any health care provider who just barely passed his/her sciences.",5.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Schiller is by far the definition of a professor that is more about getting his paycheck than legitimately teaching. I am taking his AP1 to apply for nursing and honestly cannot wait to never see him again. This is literally an undergraduate course that requires doctorate level responses for anything close to a good grade. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
"I loved Dr. Schiller. He is tough, and you have to study for sure. However, you really retain the information if you put in the work. He is a bit lecture heavy, but it is okay. Always willing to meet outside of class. Extra credit is offered on every test. Overall great guy 100% would recommend.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Schiller was a great professor! His class is not easy, but easy was not expected. He is extremely willing to help outside of class. I reviewed with him before every test but the first, and that was my lowest test grade. I did the exam reviews in the D2L and went to him before each test to go over my sketch and labels. Super helpful!",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
I would not recommend taking him. He doesnt give any chances to bring your grade up. It is 5 test that reflect your grade. He reads straight off the power points(which you can do yourself) and it doesnt really help. And his grading is tough and terrible. You could label as much as you can on your test and he still wIll give you 1/5. Dont take!,1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Worst teacher ever. Lectures super heavy, and does not slow down. You will not pass if you are a more hands on student and cannot learn well by just lectures. You are graded only off of 5 test grades but you will actually take 6 and the top five are taken as your grade. You must put in the work outside of class. He is a super dry guy.",1.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
"The best advice I could give a student in Schiller's class is to study a LOT. It will be impossible to receive a good grade in this class unless you put in the work outside of class. Go through the PowerPoints and learn how to draw all of the diagrams he shows in class (they'll help you in the short answer section). Great guy, tough class.",4.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"He is an okay teacher. However, his tests are extremely hard. They are worded as if the students are professionals. The class is only based off of 5 tests (6 with the comprehension final). His way of extra credit is by having you answer an additional short answer on the test but its too hard to even try.",2.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
He is by far the worst professor I have had here. He just lectures the entire class and does not care about whether or not you actually retain any of the information. his study guides are extremely large and broad and about 2/3 of the material on there is not even on his tests. avoid taking him if possible.,1.0,5.0,, No
"Dr. Schiller is very knowledgable but lectures A LOT. I personally found his class amusing, but I know a lot of people found him to be dry and confusing. I believe that as long as you're willing to really pay attention and follow along, his class is easy enough, but definitely not one you can pass without any effort.",4.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Textbook not needed. Totally a doable class. Nice guy, just lecture heavy. Final only counts if you do good on it. Only grades are test grades. Will have to study. Test are multiple choice with 2 mandatory free response and 1 optional for extra credit.",3.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"He is not the best at further elaborating on topics past what he already has said. Make sure to study any chance you can and use the online study guides, mastering A&P study modules, and powerpoints to help with this. He does take notes of his students and how much you show up to class/participate. A good grade wont be easy but not impossible.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Schiller is extremely dry and monotone, he goes off on tangents during lecture and rarely finishes the chapter material before its included on the exams. the verbiage on the exam questions make something simple into something incredibly confusing. Tried to meet after class for help and was blown off and dismissed, I'd recommend another prof.",1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Dr. Schiller is one of the toughest professors I have had. While his lectures are difficult, he makes it very clear they he will meet with anyone outside of class which definitely helps. You are graded solely on your tests and you must study or it will be impossible. I would recommended Schiller if you are interested in truly learning anatomy.",4.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"A&P 1 with Dr. Schiller is as hard as you make it. If you study and go to class you will pass his tests, but he does not make it easy for you.",4.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Do not take,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"You're graded based on your exams and nothing else, which HURTS. Attendance is never taken, so you're on your own entirely. Barely made it by, received a D. Overall, take 2010 with someone else if you're looking to gain from lectures and be graded for something other than exams.",1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
Dr. Shiller is fair and a very caring person if you are the type of student to show EFFORT. Participation is big for him. His exams are 85% Multiple choice with a few essay questions. His exams are definitely over the power point he provides. Make sure you do your LABS!!!,5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I had him for lab, but instead i had a student teacher teach me and he was the head honcho for all the student teachers. The TA that I got was amazing and he really taught the material well.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I took A&P in HS, so I knew lots about the subject and I was familiar with the terminology, but he presents such an abundant amount of information that it can be extremely difficult to know what to study for. You really have to want an A. He gives study guides, which make it easier, but the essay-type questions are not the same ones on the test.",3.0,4.0,, Yes

Great professor! Very helpful. I wish that I could take Dr. H for all my English classes.,5.0,2.0,,
"Dr. H was the best online professor I've had.  She keeps close watch over the class to see if help is needed. She is clear about what she expects. And it's easy to get an A if you just read the material and put some effort into your papers. If you don't want to go to campus for English, this class, with Dr. H, is for you!",5.0,2.0,,
She is so understandable and helpful. She wants you to succeed in class. I wish I could have her for every class I take.,5.0,2.0,,
"Dr.H. is GREAT! She expects a lot but I am learning a lot. The work is worth it! Although my class is online, I feel I know Dr.H. and like her almost like a friend. She's cool! Take her and you'll be glad. She cares about her subject and her students.",5.0,5.0,,
"I never got to meet Dr. Hancock because I took this course online. This was my last class before I graduated and I left it for last because I never did like English Literature.

One word Boring but easy.,3.0,2.0,,
This class was very difficult and there were lots of quizzes and a couple discussion boards. It is a very hard class but each quiz has two tries. The final exam only has one try but is a compilation of all the true/false questions on the quizzes.,3.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No

What a JERK! He is full of himself and does NOT care about you as a student or learner. Avoid his class. He is there just to amuse himself at any1's cost. He belittles you no matter your age. It's a speech class and I had to study more for his class than my A&P class and only made a B. He's a waist of money and time. He's an Unfair arrogant butt.,1.0,5.0,,
I really enjoyed his class.  He was more than willing to help if you put forth effort to try.,4.5,3.0,,
"This guy is so full of himself!! Don't bother to try and ask him any sort of question pertaining to the material, or the studio, because he will most likely try to give you a smart-alecy answer that makes no sense. He smells like a bad of dirty laundry, and is so arrogant..he is absolutely NO HELP AT ALL!!!!!",1.0,3.0,,

"I enjoyed having Prof. Butts as an instructor, but her class was difficult for me. There is a LOT of material covered in a day and she goes fast in her lectures. She hands out study guides for every chapter, but I never figured out what to prioritize studying and taking notes on, hence my final grade. Cooperative with communication. 6/10.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Okay professor but she goes too fast. I have to take notes on the power points outside of class just to stay on track. Easy online quizzes surprise in-class pop quizzes. Try to ask for a study guide before you begin a new chapter, there are at least 80 questions you need to know in those study guides. She usually gives it two days before the exam.",3.0,3.0, Mandatory,
The class started off okay but over time it got worse. Myself and other students had a difficult time following along and was hard to understand the power points as she would skip over things and even had to rush though some chapters due to her spending so much time on other chapters at the start of the semester.  Overall a very tough class. ,1.0,5.0, Mandatory,
Dr. Butts is a fantastic professor. If you have any problem she will be happy to answer it and she is understanding. The class grade is back heavy which she tries to make very clear. Do not wait to do the term paper until the last few days and you should be fine!,4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Lecture heavy and if you do not take notes you will not pass. Personally, I love the lecture/note classes, but if that is not how you learn I would not recommend it. She is very passionate and it makes her class enjoyable. She puts the study guides for every chapter on D2L and if you use those you're golden on the exams.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"So, Im a freshman and I wish someone had told me about rate my professor beforehand. Shes sweet and all but the way she teaches is awful. The study guides are ridiculously long, she goes off topic about stuff that isnt on the slides, and is no help whatsoever. Also, beware of her quizzes, if you dont match her answer exactly, its wrong.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
WORST CLASS EVER wouldnt recommend cause no .,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
All she does is lecture from start to finish. She never finishes class on time. I am always rushing because she lets out like 4 minutes late. There is a TON of essay/papers/reflections and her tests are ridiculously hard. I am a straight A student and I have yet to get an A on an assignment in her class.,2.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"VERY lecture heavy. I am a straight A student and didn't do well on an assignment and I asked if I could make corrections and resubmit, she said no. I was understanding as the assignment only gets one submission, however, the same week, she took late work from the whole semester from other students which didn't seem fair.",1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
"This is my 3rd class w/ Dr. Butts, I've taken HIST 4760 & 4770. She is without a doubt one of the best & kindest professors I've ever had. She knows what she is doing and she is very passionate about her work. She is lecture heavy & you need to study the material. But don't be afraid to email her for help/guidance, she is very understanding.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
Only take her if you are a history major. She loves what she teaches which isnt a bad thing but if you dont understand jack crap about history dont take her. Sweet lady though very understanding. However from one slow person to another DONT DO IT!,2.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"I have her currently. I have been here every single day, and yet no matter how much I pay attention and take notes, I can not pass her class.

She's nice, but I would not take again.",2.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"I had her for both HIST2010 and HIST2020. I enjoyed her course thoroughly. You don't need the textbook to pass her class, but you do have to be there. She talks a lot and some of the things she discuss aren't on the PowerPoint slides she presents, so you have to take really good notes. She's an easy-grader and understanding, and helpful.",4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr Butts is a fantastic professor within her topic, however her tests will make you pull your hair out. They are always cumulative and her study guides are essentially a list of questions that hint to what is on the test. Mind you though, the guide will have 100 questions, but the test will just have 25. Hardest effort Ive ever put in just to get",3.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"She is very nice and helpful all you have to do is put in effort to get an A! Very caring, loved her.",4.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

(Lowest grade this semester)",2.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"Dr. Butts has a very lecture heavy class, and the tests come directly from the notes. She gives quizzes at the end of each chapter, and a 5 page term paper.

Overall, she's a great teacher, but this is not an easy A.",3.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
"She talks a LOT. Her class is completely about listening to her go on and on.

On the other hand, she doesn't give much homework and she does give study guides.",3.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
"I loved this class! Dr. Butts is such a sweet lady and is always there if you need help.  Quizzes at the end of every chapter, so be ready. Two book assignments, three tests, and one five page paper along with a few other homework assignments. If you don't come to class, you'll fail, but attendance is not taken.  Don't get the textbook either.",4.0,3.0,, Yes
"had to take the class twice...studied, attended lecture, did homework and flashcards, and still only scraped by with C- (finally.)",1.0,5.0,,

Awesomely laid back teacher!,5.0,1.0,,
With everything you do in this class Dr. Pigg always goes over it with you and will help you if needed. I have found the best way to get ahold of him is through text messages which he will give you the number at the beginning of class. ,4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I like Dr. Pigg as a person. He is funny and very knowledgeable about what he teaches. But, he is kind of boring in his presenting of material and does not explain things well. His instructions were always confusing, too. If you do the reading and take notes, you'll pass but still be confused about everything. I didn't learn anything in this class.",2.0,3.0, Not Mandatory,
"You can tell he is super passionate about what he does. very funny and is always trying to get you excited about whatever you're discussing in class. LOTS of reading required for this class, but its in short chunks and the journals are very easy. He will basically give 100s for just attempting the work. Can tell he wants all his students to succeed",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Pigg is a great professor! This is my second class with him and I would certainly take him again! There is a TON of reading, but he helps you to understand what you are reading and puts it into context. All of his assignments are fairly straightforward. Just pay attention to his lectures, do the work, and ask for feedback!",5.0,3.0,, Yes
"His class was just really boring. The material wasn't bad, and you only have a few papers to do, but I always dreaded this class simply because he wasn't good at engaging the students.",2.0,1.0, Mandatory, No
"You NEED to read to pass this class. He's lecture heavy, but tries to make it more than that. A few in class group work, a 15 minute group presentation, and a 5-6 page paper. 3 tests. He gives you a study guide before each test that makes it pretty easy to pass. He grades lightly, so that's a plus. I can't imagine it'd be easy to fail this class.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, No
Loved this class! It took alot of my time but the class was great. Dr. Pigg was great at answering emails and providing feedback. I would definitely take him again.,5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Great Professor!,4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Pigg was very easy going and open minded. Great start to freshman year,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Pigg is very lecture based, so if you're a visual learner it might be difficult. But he explains things well and he'll answer any questions you have. Be prepared for daily journals, 1 group presentation, and 1 paper. The tests are easy as long as you read the material. He's a pretty easy grader which is a huge relief. I would take him again.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Pigg is a wonderful professor. In this class you will read a LOT of plays and you will have to read aloud in class. He has tests, but they are out of class and open book for the most part. You will have to give a presentation and write a 6 page paper.",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Pigg was an awesome teacher. He is very understanding with assignments. He is so passionate about what he teaches it makes it easy to get interested. We watched a lot of movies and had to write papers on them. It was a different approach to essays but it made the class that much more enjoyable. Do the work and it is an easy A.,4.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Just take Dr. Pigg. He is an easy grader but you also feel like you are learning. We watched a bunch of movies. You really did not have to read the books, but I did anyways.

Dr. Pigg's assignments are v involved with the books assigned but at the most skimming the readings & finding a few key points to talk about in class seemed to be good enough. On his syllabus his attendance policy was strict but I skipped fairly often due to work/family emergencies (and even skipped a key assignment - opps!) and still got an A.,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes

"I took Dr. Pigg for Secondary English Methods, and it was a great class! Dr. Pigg really cares about his students, and he wants to help you succeed. He's very passionate about teaching, but he is also very busy! He did not return over half of the assignments, and he doesn't use Canvas, so I had no idea what I was making until final grades were out",4.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Pigg is an amazing teacher. He grades fairly easy on papers. He's funny and easy going. He admires people who speak up in class and answers his questions. Try to attend all his lectures because he does notice who doesn't show up and who does. He gives 6 papers and all are fairly easy and relatively short. 10/10 would recommend.,4.0,2.0,, Yes
"Dr. Pigg tends to be VERY vague, but hes also very understanding. Hes also hilarious. Hell work with you if he doesnt have his stuff together, which happens sometimes.",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Pigg is so easy for English 111! You write a lot of papers but they are very easy and always short! He gives a couple options for each paper as well. At the end of the semester you get to watch movies and they are actually good movies. Easy grader and super funny in class. Attendance is mandatory though so don't take him if you won't show up!,5.0,1.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I personally loved Mr. Pigg. You can tell he actually cares about what he is teaching and does his best to make sure his students know the information. If you ask for help, he is always willing to help. You do have to do journal entries for every class period, so if youre someone who doesnt go to class often, dont take his class.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"His teaching varies depending on how interested he is in the class. His true passion lies with Ceramics, and any other class he teaches seems to be a hassle to him. He gets offended if people don't show up to class, but he skips class on a regular basis. I get the vibe that he's still teaching here because he gets to use the facility.",2.0,2.0, Mandatory,
Clearly cares about his students.  He is passionate about ceramics and wants you to be also,3.5,4.0, Not Mandatory,
"I wasn't nervous about this class until I learned that we would be focusing on the human form. McBeth was incredibly helpful whenever I had questions (though sometimes I did have to go look for him).

"I have taken 3D design, beginning ceramics, two semesters of advanced ceramics (about to be three) and a special topics raku class with him. Made all A's. He's awesome, but he's not going to hold your hand. You're an adult and he's going to treat you like one. He grades a lot on effort. Ask ?s, be attentive, and give it your all, you'll do great.",5.0,4.0,,

If i have a mentor at this school it's this man!!!,5.0,1.0,,
"I do not understand the people who say he doesn't care. OBVIOUSLY they did not talk to him or ask him any questions. If you are a good art student who works hard and takes pride and effort in what you do, he will notice you. Otherwise if you are in there to get an easy grade and don't care....he will notice you don't give a hoot so neither will he.",5.0,1.0,,

"No idea how he figures your grade.  He never returned any graded items.  We thought we would have A's, but he doesn't give alot of them and we have no idea what we did wrong.  Nice guy, a little strange, but I liked him.  He is always respectful of your work.",3.0,3.0,,
"Do not take Mr. McBeth if you want to receive timely feedback, to actually use the textbook you spent good money to buy, to stay awake for lectures, to use three credit hours on a class which will actually help you accomplish something worthwhile. I came out of his class with a semester of frustration and a meaningless and far too easy A.",1.5,1.0,,
"McBeth is easy going, and lots of fun. He isn't too task oriented, but expects things to get done. He's not like any teacher I've EVER had before. Take this man, not because his classes aren't difficult, but rather because if you choose not to, you'll be missing out on a great person, friend, and teacher.",4.0,2.0,,
"McBeth is a strange, lovable person. Going into this class, I assumed that my time was being wasted, because of his ""different"" teaching style. I was wrong. In taking him for drawing, I became a better drawer. Recommended. He is easy, and easy to get along with",3.0,1.0,,
"Great guy, Easy to get along with, he is willing to take his time to show you what you need to do and is very patient with those who dont. The class is great to take, lets you unwind from the other classes, Be ready to get messy. All he expects you to do is to try, and hopes that you get better. Excellent Teacher.",4.5,1.0,,

He is a joker though and he's pretty funny.",1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory,

His expertise and teaching  In the field of Asia makes me realize why i became a history major, to better examine our world.

"Case of wonderful person; terrible teacher. Three papers worth 25% of your grade, the other 25% is participation. The books are absolutely mandatory because that is how you will learn the material.

"Long is an amazing scholar but a TERRIBLE professor. He reads off his powerpoints word for word in HTY107 every single class. However, the class is extremely easy. Three tests which he gives you the questions to before, and you can bring in a sheet of notes. Super easy but super boring. He's a super nice guy but hard to understand and just terrible",1.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, No
The best and worst prof at UMO.   He's likely the best Viet. history professor in the US.  Google him.   He's fascinating for a history student in a high level class.  If you don't take his Vietnam class you're missing a unique chance  He's also bad teacher with an accent.  Low level history reqs for non majors will be excruciating,2.5,2.0,,
"Long's class on the Vietnam War is quite simply most interesting and fulfilling class I have ever taken in college.  His lectures can be a little dry but he is actually really funny.  He is the first to admit his accent is difficult to understand.  If you are not interested in the course material it may be hard to push through, though.",4.5,5.0,,
"Yes his accent is a little hard to understand, but the real issue for me was his teaching style. Every class involves him reading off of full pages of powerpoints word for word and is extremely boring. If you have a question, he will often answer by asking another question. The only good part of this class is that he hands out the test beforehand",2.0,4.0,,
"Lectures were outrageously boring. I was genuinely interested in the material, but listening to him read a power point to us in monotone for 50 mins strait felt like  torture.  Nonetheless, the exams were easy because he gives u the topics b4 hand so u just need 2 do a little research the night b4 and you'll be fine, even if you didn't attend much.",2.0,1.0,,
"I took this course as an elective (I am in MEE). The professor is very knowledgeable and slips some humor into the lectures, but has a thick accent. Honestly, I went to half the lectures, but even then, this course was much harder than expected. DO NOT take this course unless you plan on attending ALL the lectures.",1.5,5.0,,
"When I took his HTY 107 class it was not easy to follow every word that he was saying, but he was articulate enough that, if you were actually paying close attention, you could retain a good amount of the material. I decided to take his 400 level class on US-Vietnamese Relations and I have to say that it was brilliantly thought-provoking.",4.5,3.0,,
Very hard to understand. Class is painful and long. Is funny and has a good sense of humor. If you take this class sit in the front row so you can hear and understand him!!!!!!!!!!!,2.0,5.0,,
Students who complain about him are the ones you will see flipping burgers at Mcdonalds next year. Professor Long believes in self motivation and indipendant self study. If you like that than go for his classes if you want to slack off why go to college? He is the best professor I have had here at U Maine. Listen to him you will learn a lot.,4.5,3.0,,
"I am taking 442 right now. This guy has to be the biggest catch 22 at UMaine. He is insanely knowledgeable about the topic but he has no idea how to teach. He also is almost impossible to understand, very thick accent. Mumbles and uh uh uh's a lot. He just reads texts and has NO class participation. Same lectures everyday. Easy grader though.",2.0,1.0,,
"His low-level classes pretty much stink, but his 400-level classes are great. With small classes he was very laid-back, let us out early, etc. He does little actual teaching, though, be prepared because in his 400-level courses you basically read the texts and teach yourself the material. Only take his classes if you really like the subject.",3.0,4.0,,
"I wanna give this guy the benefit of the doubt, because I think he is a smart guy, but man...his accent is impossible.  Mumbles too, couldn't hear a word so I just never went to class...ever.  Didn't buy the text either, but still got an A thanks to my good friend Wikipedia...easy class, but don't even bother attending, it's worthless to go.",2.0,1.0,,
"The textbook assignments aren't worth wasting your time on; the book is only useful for researching the test questions. Lectures were often useful in understanding what Professor Long thinks about George W. Bush's policies, but were often useless otherwise. However, to his credit, Professor Long is clearly very intelligent and knowledgeable.",2.5,4.0,,
"I took East Asian Civ with Professor Long and enjoyed it a lot.  A lot of people in this class where turned off by his soft voice and accent, but the good news is that he does not take attendance and his tests are pretty much open book.  Professor long himself is extremely smart (first Vietnamese to go to Harvard) and not to mention very nice.",3.0,2.0,,
"He's a nice guy, but I can't understand half the things he says which makes me not want to pay attention.",1.0,4.0,,
"HARSH grader. Feels impossible to get an A on anything, even discussion posts. She gave D grades on discussions for missing one thing. No study guide is provided for the mid-term/final, even though it requires you to answer essay questions from articles weeks back. TONS of reading. Multiple books, plus articles every week. Not set up for success.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"I have had Dr. Eller for a couple of classes and they are for sure difficult. It seems no matter if you take and apply all of her feedback, you still will not make above a B on any assignment. Gave me a 19/20 on most discussion posts... and no feedback on why I got one point taken off. Just frustrating after you spend so much time reading.",2.0,5.0,, No
"Unless you absolutely have to have this class, do not take it. It is a lot of lecture material that will require a lot of time. You have discussion posts due each week, one page summaries (tons of those), a big project due at the end, and a midterm and final, which is very content heavy. She is a tough grader and not worth the stress overall.",1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
"The reading never stops and the grades are hard-earned. I would not take this unless you are willing to take tests over 8 or more long articles at a time, plus several chapters. It was truly overwhelming to keep up with all of the reading material. She seems to not give full credit on anything. Want an A? Don't take her class.",1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
I took her online class and it is the most work I have ever done for a class. Textbook and other reading required. Papers and discussions every week and OC papers are required. She is retired so she has nothing else better to do than grade very harshly. I would recommend never taking her class if you have anything else in your life than school.,1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
I've taken Dr Eller for two online classes. She assigns many journal articles and text chapters so you have to read a LOT to be prepared. Usually only tests are a midterm and final which are VERY hard. Mostly essay questions that you need to connect back to the reading. You will learn a lot though.,4.0,4.0,, Yes
Her class is not hard at all. The problem is that her method of grading is ridiculous. For two different sections we would have to do the same thing. But the grades would be so different from each other. Her class is the online class that I ever gotten less than a B on for a discussion post.,2.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, No
"The class I took was seminar-based, not lecture-heavy. I feel the lecturing Dr. Eller did was lacking in depth and quality of commentary. She gave out multiple long articles a week for us to read. Many of the articles had a social justice, leftist tint to them, and weren't concrete academic social science.",1.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
She gives so many papers and you will have to read to many articles. The tests are unfair. She is a mediocre teacher and you will be so bored in her class.,2.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"Dr. Eller is irreverent, hilarious, and brilliant, but she will make you work, think, and Read. Her lectures kept everyone tuned in. You may feel like a brick has hit you in the head and later want to thank her. Take her if you came to college for a reason, just don't be a slacker.",4.5,5.0,,
"Taking a course from Dr. Eller is akin to having your brain cracked open everyday. She will break you down and build you up, she expects you to work on the courseload as hard as she has. Don't waste her time, or yours, if you aren't dedicated to learning the subject matter.",3.5,5.0,,
"Very difficult professor.Would often give low grades w/ little input.Never satisfied,never gave positive feedback.Save yourself the heartache & take a different professor.",1.5,5.0,,

Saul knows how to keep every lecture interesting and engaging. An immediately like-able guy with a vast amount of knowledge on his subject.

She is a horrible professor! she does not work with struggling students and gives false information for papers. she is has a nasty attitude and talks down to her students. i felt like i was in grade school while in her class. even my reading professor told me that it was a big mistake taking her.,1.0,5.0,,
"By far one of the worst professors I've ever had. The thing that bothered me the most was that we would take our tests with a very vague idea of what they covered, she NEVER reviewed the study questions beforehand, then AFTER we took the test she would go over the material that the test was on... If you take this class all I can say is good luck.",1.5,3.0, Not Mandatory,

She shows up late a lot and gets off topic often. It is very important to take notes during her 'lectures' and do the study questions! If you do both you will pass. Towards the end of the semester she gets lazy just like students. I didn't mind having her as a teacher.,2.5,3.0,,

Great professor. He wrote the book himself so not only is it a lot cheaper but he knows the material he has to cover. If you read the book you will get an A. He translates the language of economics into easy to understand concepts for students. Do your part and you will get an A,5.0,2.0,,

Tepperman is awful. He makes this class so much harder than it needs to be and it's all thanks to his laziness. His tests test the most specific details that are not related to sociology.

Awful experience. He just give us the recordings and let us watch them at home. Students are not very involved in this course. ,1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory,
This course is so boring and there are so many readings to do. The professor tested us on numbers and statistics in the book and the tests are closed book.

Tests are doable but you need to memorize every single word.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
Probably the worst professor I've ever had and I've been here 4 years now. Outright refused to accommodate my accessibility needs.

Its the most rewarding class.",5.0,5.0, Mandatory, Yes

I did learn a lot from this course though...",3.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
It's unfortunate that the tests and quizzes ask about the smallest details in the readings. Almost every test and quiz we have written this semester has had to have questions omitted because he was testing on the wrong content.

He is a very tough grader. I am a B average student but I could not get higher than a 79% on his exams. He is very unclear with what he wants for his papers. For his exams he wants extra information that was not in the lectures or textbooks.,1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No

I would definitely take him again in another astronomy course.",4.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes

Prof Lloyd is an eccentric individual I took his physics class and passed without trying very hard. If you go to class regularly and try your best on the quizzes/exams (8 quizzes 4 exams) you'll be okay. Don't skip lecture though because he covers everything you need to know and DO THE HOMEWORK.

Lloyd is a pretty chill professor but his teaching style is more teach yourself. His book was written by him and he doesn't check the book work.

I think I'll have a crick in my neck for a year after looking straight up at his lectures all semester. ",1.0,4.0, Mandatory,

Talks low, and can be funny.",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Sit at the very front as he speaks very low and writes very small. Understand the first 2 chapters very clearly as it is the basis for everything else. His notes are clear but the textbook offers more detail. Speeds through lectures very quickly so it is difficult to follow. Exam problems often have a twist so be familiar with different approaches.,3.0,4.0,, No
This teacher is the epitome of stupidity at best. He can't lecture properly because he mumbles all the time. He doesn't give mandatory hw which would help the class but the biggest issue was his grading policy.

"In class lectures are interesting, I always enjoyed going to class. Tests can be difficult, it's application based so you need to know the material well. He is very picky when it comes to grading. Oh, and if you're doing something incorrectly on assignments he won't tell you; you will just have to wait until midterms to find that out.",3.5,3.0,,
I had Dr. Saarnio for child psy & motivation. His classes are not mandatory but if u want to pass go to class. In motivation there is no book so dont be afraid to ask questions. He wants u to understand the material not just know it for the test.If u hate talking infront of ppl dont take this class presentations are a must.,5.0,3.0,,

He's incredible!,4.5,4.0,,

i think he is great!!!,4.0,2.0,,

I really like Dr.. Johnson but I have a really hard time understanding him which made this class really difficult. It's really hard to study for the tests. I honestly hate to give him a bad rating because he's smart and a great teacher but its very difficult when you can't understand the teacher.,3.0,5.0,,
"I took Dr. Johnson this summer and the only grades he took were over the five tests he gave in four weeks, with no study guide or any type of extra credit.

"Doc. Johnson is freaking hilarious! I wrote down all his jokes in my notebook everyday. yea he is quiet and cracks himself up, but if you listen you will see why he is laughing.

"This man did nothing more than display his prejudiced opinions every class period. If anyone disagreed or attempted to call him out, he basically called you an idiot and changed the subject.

"If you ever thought ""Hey, I want to take a class where the professor insults my intelligence by reading off powerpoints all day"" then take Johnson.

"At first I was totally scared by the fact that I could hardly understand him and the fact that there is no way to get the notes if you miss a class, unless you know someone.

"Impossible to understand. Gives answers to study guides, though. Memorize those and you'll do fine. He says he doesn't take questions from the reading, but sometimes he does. No role taking. If you can get the notes from someone, no reason to go to class b/c you can't hear him anyway.",1.5,3.0,,
His class was very hard because of the fact he didn't use the book and everything came off of the projector. also he doesn't take roll so if your a person that doesn't come to class when teachers don't take roll don't take him. he is very hard to understand because of a condition he has so he talks through a microphone. DON'T TAKE!!,2.0,3.0,,
"This is a very easy class.  The test comes straight from the notes.  He gives answers to the study guide before the test, but you do have to study them.

It's usually just corny/funny stuff.",2.5,2.0,,

"Awesome professor. Clearly loves calculus, and it shows in his lectures. He sometimes brings up material from future courses, or unique examples to show what you can do with calculus, and what you will be able to do.

I really liked having Barry! He says a lot of jokes in his lectures that you may only catch if your'e really paying attention because he doesn't laugh. Which I think makes it funnier. His notes were really good easy to read and understand. Doesn't make you feel dumb if you answer a question wrong and explains well.,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Awful teacher and human being. I had him for two or three weeks and decided I would rather NOT do math at all than be taught by a terrible prof who takes marks off for stupid things (or who can't make sure his own assignments are printed correctly).,1.0,3.0, Mandatory, No

"Good prof, his lectures are very clear and easy to follow. The tests are very fair and so is the exam (you can bring one help sheet with any content you want on it for the exam). Probability was a tough unit because of the wording in questions but other than that it was easy to do well if you did practice questions and your weekly assignments. ",4.0,3.0,,
Easy A. There were weekly assignments that typically took an hour to do each. Midterms were way harder than the final. The final itself was extremely easy. ,2.5,1.0,,

"Barry is great! SO clear and teaches math in such a way that even the worst students at math can excel. He is super sweet, quirky and funny! Loved his class. His explanations are very clear.

This professor did a good job of teaching the concepts to a class of Arts students that hadn't done math since grade 11. He gives you opportunities to boost your mark with the assignments so make sure you do all of them! Only downfall is he doesn't do any sort of review before the exams so it is up to you to try and figure out what he expects.,3.5,3.0,,
"Decent Prof.  Is pretty clear and will take time to explain concepts.  However, doesn't post marks, and has no review sections for exams.  Tutorials are useless as well, as you stand in line for an hour waiting to get your question answered privately.  Could be better, but could also be alot worse.",4.0,4.0,,
Barry is really useless. He is very stuck up and is not motivating at all. He is a perfect example of how some university professors just don't care about their students. He makes me NOT want to be in math (which is the opposite of what he is there to do). Advice for Barry; try making your students feel like you care about them and their education.,1.5,3.0,,

He's a great prof but it's hard to pay attention to him talk throughout the entire lecture.

"Very clear and concise. Has a knack for explaining concepts in a way that you'll remember them.

Knows what he's talking about but doesn't bother to talk about it much! A great guy.",4.0,1.0, Mandatory,

"The worst teacher I've ever had in my entire life.  His VERY FIRST WORDS to our class were ""well, I might not show up on time - if I'm not here by 9, feel free to go"".  You are only graded on things you have no chance to practice beforehand (i.e. get it right the first time, or drop out).  Doesn't even make any of his own slides.  AVOID AT ALL COST",1.0,3.0,,

"He is the worst, worst proff ever. After a 40 % average on the midterm, he comes to class saying ""this is a wake up call for me"" except now he does less.

We are sure gonna have fun in the other ece courses without knowing hashtables",1.0,5.0,,

"He told us some material wasn't covered on our midterm. Then he gave a 20 % mark question on that. Long midterm with questions on projects we haven't done yet. He is very rude. He said ""whoever failed that midterm belongs in the gutter"". He can't teach jack. When this guy talks, time stops. So slow and monotonic. Made my favorite course a disaster.",1.0,5.0,,
"I gotta disagree w/ others. I think this guy DOES show an interest in teaching. You can tell he tries to make lectures interesting, and encourages you to think. It's just the course material was dry. What sucks tho is the amt of time spent on project wasn't proportional to amt of marks it was worth, but that's not his fault. He's not bad really.",4.5,3.0,,
"Has no interest in teaching you.    Never ask for extra help because you won't get it  Project for this course is the worst i've ever seen in 5 years of engineering.

"Agree with comment (5/31/05). Boring... stopped attending and didn't make much of a difference.  Project is only related to small part of course, is much work, but marking was really easy. Procrastination on it recommended as otherwise you'll waste time for very few marks. Lots of notes, but final was easy requiring little knowledge.",2.0,2.0,,

Can't teach. Lecture notes full of mistakes. Can't write understandable sentences.  Assumes too much.  Can't tell jokes.  Doesn't give out marking schemes on projects.  Basically he can't teach and he doesn't care about it.,1.0,4.0,,

"It is a tough class; but his tests are very similar to the material from the notes.   Definately attend all his class because the notes from univerrsity copy is not all filled (you have to attend class to fill in the blank).

He is a cute old man. I managed to barely get an A in the class. I kept up with the lectures and missed the occasional lab and quiz. I didn't like his notes all that much because I always felt like I understood everything and yet I didn't do terribly well on the tests (except for the first one).,3.5,2.0,,
Horrible teacher- Got an A from going to Lance the stats tutor.  He was soo boring and his tests are nothing like the quizzes and labs.  First test is hardest. He likes definitions and not numbers.  Bad teacher,2.0,4.0, Mandatory,
Tries to make the material interesting but fails miserably; tendency to abstract things.  Lectures could cure insomnia (slightly less so if you attend live).

Research assignments were difficult and time consuming. Midterm and final were long but fair. Very helpful in office hours.",4.0,4.0,,
"Tax is ... tax. The prof is great though, can't help it that the subject is hard. Go to class and try your best to look at the material before hand. Midterm and Final were really hard.

"Tough course, keep up with the work for sure. Do the assigned problems AHEAD of time or you'll be lost. The final exam was super tough and long, especially since there was 3 big questions instead of 2 big and 2 smaller like on the final 04. Ken tried to make the class interesting with his enthusiasm and morning cartoons but he needs to teach more.",3.0,4.0,,
This is like a self study course...which I think is inappropriate considering that tax is hard and most people don't have prior experiences with it... he should teach the material instead of just telling us to learn from the text,3.0,5.0,,
This guy is useless in general. The course notes are pretty bad and the material is hard to learn considering the tax exam had to be belled by 30% fall 2005!!! He might as well just post the solutions to inclass problems so we don't have to waste time.,1.5,4.0,,
Hmm...well he was a OK prof but his final was pretty long (not enough time to finish) and he RARELY checks his e-mail which sucks.  Also I don't like the fact that all he does is takes up the homework problems...teach us something Ken!  You should have just put up the answers on ACE instead of wasting our time...no value added here for sure.,2.0,3.0,,

Great prof and good course,5.0,5.0,,
"I took both CS 430 and 432 with her. CS432~ she was good. CS 430~ kill me! She is a hard, hard marker and even though you explain what you did and why it may be correct, she will NOT agree. Basically her way or the highway. Other than that, she is okay. Take her. Nothing wow... just take it",4.0,3.0,,
Way too much content on slides... Basically have to study every single little detail in order to do well on test and assignments (because of the strict marking scheme). Have to put in a lot of work to get the mark you want in the class.,3.0,4.0,,
"Awesome prof, if you show up to every class and keep up, you will do great. She isn't easy, but I'm not buying marks, I'm buying the chance to learn, and get a degree that actually means something. If UW profs were easy, then our degrees would mean nothing. She tries hard to make a boring subject interesting, and does a good job at it.",5.0,3.0,,
Great prof and very usefull course,5.0,4.0,,
"Took both CS430/432.  If you keep up with the work (which is not difficult), you will enjoy any term where you have her as your prof :).  It also helps to be fluid with English, because she will get somewhat irritated if you are not clear (aka asian) with your communication!  Great prof, were the only 2 courses I actually enjoyed.",4.0,1.0,,
"I took both cs 430 and 432 from Suzanne this term. I had her back to back for almost 3 hours. She did a superb job in both courses. always well prepared, very enrgetic, good examples and great delivery. I don't know my marks yet, but I am confident I did well in both courses and I learned a lot from these 2 courses.",5.0,3.0,,
"Overall, she is a very ""OK"" prof. The good: Her slides are very complete and organized (but I would hope they would be since she's been teaching the course for a decade!). Her accent is awesome. The bad: Her classes are not interesting (partially due to the subject matter) and she gets very frustrated when no one participates in class.",2.5,3.0,,
Excellent teacher and great course. I learned a lot from this course and suzanne did superb job teaching it. Wish i could take more courses from her. She cares about her students.,5.0,3.0,,

"Useful course, great Prof, and fair exam. She really cares about her students ? answered my email question, even on weekends. Used excellent examples, related to our coop jobs, so we could relate the course material to our job experience. I?ll be taking 432 in Fall & I hope she will be teaching it.",5.0,4.0,,
Took both 430 & 432 from her this term. Enjoyed both courses. Very useful & practical courses. Just did a job interview last week & found out today I have a job as business analyst. Used lot of things I learned in these 2 courses during interview. Excelle prof. treated everybody nicely but did not take BS from some students who were totaly lost,5.0,3.0,,
One word to describe her class = boring! She makes it way harder than it needs to be by marking extremely strict and not being flexible at all about it. Class consisted of an hour and 20 minutes a day of dry and slow lectures.,2.0,4.0,,

"CS 430 may have been itty easier than CS 432, but Prof Safayeni is terrific for both courses.  These courses are not too difficult if you do the assignments and read through the notes a few times.  There is a lot of memory work involved, but the prof is always available for help if needed.  Wish she taught more CS courses!",5.0,3.0,,
"Prof Safyeni is awesome.  I bugged her for help a lot outside of class, and she was always available.  Though I did fall asleep a few times during her lecture, I think that was due to the boring subject matter as opposed to her actual lecturing.  She is a great prof, and I look forward to taking another class with her.",4.5,2.0,,

"He is a nice man. But oral presentation needs to be tightened. Meaning he needs to get to the point and be more organized. He rants for 30 minutes before each class which he should probably stop. Do the reading and you will pass, no need to go to class. He is kind of funny. Would not take again.",3.0,2.0,,
"Entirely based on readings - easily could skip every class and pass. Goes on long winded rantsnot about course. BUT to make up for his boring, random approach, he is an easy marker.",2.0,4.0,,
"Professor has a wealth of knowledge and holds long classes--this may account for boring/monotonous accusations from other reviewers. However, Jaworsky  is an extremely helpful and personable prof, probably in the top 10% of profs I've had. Midterms easy to do good in if you memorize and he gives very helpful paper feedback if you see him.",4.5,3.0,,
"Prof makes you take pointless notes in class that you won't need to know on exam. Exams are brutal. He takes random sentences from assigned readings (which can be up to 450 pages long) and makes you fill them in. Ex: ""The___is stable""(?!?!). Studied over 30 hours for each midterm/final, and marks don't show it...they're avg. Don't recommend class.",1.5,4.0,,
Jaworsky is a nice guy and he is friendly but his midterm surely wasn't. It was literally next to impossible due to the format of it. There were about 140 questions which students had to answer with one word or a phrase. Good luck to anyone who is taking this class with him.,3.5,3.0,,
Very nice professor. Friendly to students; class is relaxed and he often makes really funny jokes about russia. Fair grading.,5.0,1.0,,
Super nice professor. Recommend attending class as he gives tips all the time. He's really enthusiastic about the material and tells great jokes.,4.0,2.0,,

"Overall decent. Is a nice and relatively helpful guy, but the course wasn't as good as I had hoped. Midterm was hard and was based almost entirely on memorizing names, dates, etc. Exam almost exclusively focused on course readings rather than lecture notes. However, he was very generous with the essay-marking.",3.5,3.0,,
I don't recommend this class at all.  Very tough and lectures are extremely boring!  Dont take if u want a deceNt grade or class,2.5,4.0,,
"This guy is actually useless. Most boring and monotonous professor I have ever had. I feel like he doesn't even know what he is talking about. Readings were interesting, however no relevance to the actual test. Test was an unfair and useless test of knowledge. Too bad this uncharismatic and incompetent teacher taught a course which had potential.",1.0,5.0,,

"lectures are boring, i was not  inspired at all, i am writing my term paper right now, and i i dont care at all, about this topic, or this course... i still think that ethnicity is quite interesting, but this course did not really have much of interesting or enthusiasm in the topics... very very dry would be a good way of describing the course",1.0,4.0,,
"Pretty good lecturer, but never uses and kind of visual aids so sometimes it is difficult to discern his main argument.  Overall, good prof.",2.5,4.0,,
He's very helpful and very understanding. His lectures are clear and he does repeat some things a lot...but it only reinforces your learning.,4.0,3.0,,
"An OK prof. Russia is interesting all by itself, and the textbook was OK. Overall pretty fair, but he's really disorganized and likes to repeat himself a lot.

Notes are very clear.  Too bad he's a jerk,3.5,4.0,,

"His lecture is very well organized and goes very slow and you thought you have totally understand everything (in fact not) , but the exams are extremely difficult, and do not have curve.

In addition, He is not reachable most of the time.",2.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Read the textbook before class. He expects you to do this and trust me it helps a lot.  Didn't enjoy lectures as much because of his accent, and whenever he lectures he sometimes speaks to the board so it can be hard to hear at times.  Nice guy though!",2.0,4.0, Mandatory, No

She teaches well. We had tech issues for a bit but its good now. She is by far the best multi option. PROFESSORS MATTER FOR MULTI (things arent standardized).

No crib sheet, so lots of memorizing formulas. Take someone else if you can.",2.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"Ok so she is a really nice person, but her class is tough. I lost a lot of points because she had weekly quizzes which were worth 25% of the grade in the end.

Good professor. Lectures are long but she has good examples. Homework and tests are straightforward.,4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Her lectures were extremely important. It didn't always make sense because she did teach a lot in terms of variables but she made up for it by including examples and provides realistic practice problems. She was a great teacher and was really trying to get feedback from students and help them based on the feedback. Tests are straightforward.,3.5,1.0, Not Mandatory,

"Dr. Steinbart is a great instructor. She is well prepared every lecture. She will provide worksheets and chapter outlines. She will clarify  topics and concepts before moving on. Very approachable.

The lecture is recorded and posted on Canvas so you don't have to physically attend the lecture. Quiz and Midterm problems are quite easy. The Final is very similar to the problems that appeared in midterms and quizzes. Studio attendance counts towards the final grade (maximum of 2%). You can definitely get an A in this course. ,4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Probably one of the easiest diff eq professors. Lecture attendance is not required and all the material can be learned from TAs in studio and/or Sebastian Fernandez on Youtube. Quizzes and tests are similar to provided review problems but way easier.,5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"If you have a great TA, you can learn the majority of the material just in studio. Chen's lecture slides are also quite comprehensive. His tests are much easier than the studio worksheets and his review packet, although I found the final to be a bit of a curveball.",3.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Take him for diff eq. Easiest, most straight forward class. Not much variety in tests year-to-year. Never went to lecture, only went to studio. Hes not an amazing professor but the content is not tricky so you'll do fine studying with friends for exams/quizzes.",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"A breather compared to any other math class I've taken, but only because of Chen. Makes quizzes and exams super easy. Lecture is very long and not engaging, so watch recorded lectures at 2x speed. Sebastian Fernandez is helpful, but quizzes/test/homeworks are incredibly similar to lecture. Studio is extremely helpful.",4.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Lectures are uninsightful, robotic, and difficult to learn from. Learn from TA/Sebastian Fernandez. Diffeq class material is easy to grasp, it's a mix of linear & calc and Chen tests us on basic calc2/integration by parts only. Final had one basic Euler's Method question, the other nine q's were a lot like ones from past quizzes.",4.0,2.0, Not Mandatory,
All his questions on quizzes/exams are mild and doable,4.0,2.0, Not Mandatory,
Not really difficult if you review the slides he posts on Canvas and lecture videos. Studios will give u added 2 points to your final grade which is great. He's grading criteria isn't too bad; on quizes and test he'd give you partial credit for questions.  I recommend going to studio sessions which will give u extra credit points and preparation,5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

"I personally did not find this class difficult at all (scored a 100 on everything) but I also used every single resource given to me because I enjoyed it (textbook, lectures, recitations). Just show your work on quizzes/exams and make sure to follow submission guidelines for end of the semester extra credit.",4.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Professor Chen is great because he's easy, his grading is very favorable. The content can be difficult at times but the tests and quizzes are super simple and based on the problems done in class.

"Terrible lectures, I watched Sebastian Fernandez's MATH 2552 lecture series for the whole semester and was fine. Other than that, quizzes/exams are generally straightforward. Final exam was a little harder than expected, but it was fine because all previous quizzes/midterms were pretty doable.",3.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Professor Chen is a solid choice for this class. His lectures are a bit lack luster; reviewing his amazing slide deques and finishing his comprehensive practice problem set should be enough to do well. His exams and quizzes are easy given when I took his class in Fall 2020, he he allotted a lot of time for them and they were open note.",4.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Like most math professors at Tech, he doesn't really care about teaching. If you read the textbook though, you'll be fine. No need to attend lecture because he has a thick accent. Quizzes and tests are pretty easy.",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Diff eq is not really hard but it was a breeze with Dr. Chen. His review packet prepares you well for quizzes/exams, being that if you understood those, the real questions would often be an easier and reduced version. Super active on Piazza, on top of things, clear grading, just take him for diff eq if you don't want a hard time.",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Very fair and understanding.,5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Very bad at lecturing with an extremely heavy accent. Very hard to understand. Tests and quizzes aren't too bad. Heavily relied on other sources for my knowledge. Take him but don't expect to learn from him.,1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
Doesn't know how to properly teach material to students by any means. His dull math lectures consisted of reading off of a prewritten notes sheet. I stopped going to lecture after the first week. Watch Sebastian Fernandez on YouTube and you too will never return to lecture. I would take again because of how the class is structured.,1.0,2.0,, Yes
"Chen is a terrible explainer. Majority of the class never attended his online synchronous lectures, but instead used YouTube videos and recitation to learn the material. He was lenient with changing the homework due date when needed! His homeworks, tests, and quizzes are pretty easy (thus why many ppl passed without learning through him).",2.0,2.0,, Yes

too busy for his students,1.0,5.0,,
should add more practical examples,1.5,3.0,,
Actually an articulate teacher!!  All of his words sound like what they're supposed to sound like!!  Very clear lectures.  VERY good teacher.,5.0,2.0,,
The person who gave me the idea to what extent you can rely on your data. Thia course scared me at first and made me admire it after some time. Pr Duever represents statistics as a useful tool in engineering design and not as the boring set of rules. He expects you to come up with resonable questions. Notes are hilarious,5.0,3.0,,

"I like Woodruff. I took her for Abnormal and Attitudes Toward Death & Dying. She's entertaining, but doesn't use visual aides, so if you don't take notes, you need to read extra carefully. What that bothered me was the suicide portion of ATDD. She almost jokes about it, and seems a little insensitive. Definitely beware of that before  signing up.",3.5,2.0, Not Mandatory,
"She's a weird but wonderful prof. She somehow makes an hour and 15 minute lecture riveting. She only gives 3 tests the entire semester, and they aren't particularly difficult, but if you skip class you definitely won't pass them since a lot of material is from the lectures. It's not hard to pay attention. Purchase the outline she talks about!!",3.5,2.0, Not Mandatory,

"Attendance is 100% mandatory unless you read the textbook from cover to cover because all lectures are given verbally (no powerpoints or notes exist), and no information is posted online.

"Ok, if you want to pass this class you HAVE to attend class. She only teaches verbally. No power points - no anything - just verbal teaching. She talks, you listen and write it down. Before each exam she will tell you what definitions to focus on, which helps alot. She has a good heart. Also one 12 page paper! 3 Exams and 12 page paper.",4.0,2.0,,
Professor Woodruff is a fantastic professor. I highly recommend taking her for abnormal psychology.,5.0,1.0,,
"Class is completed based on 2 tests but they are super easy and straight forward. She tells you what to study and know before the tests are given, and the material is very interesting. She knows what she is talking about and has many personal accounts for every topic. Highly suggest taking her for ATTITUDES TOWARDS DEATH AND DYING",4.0,2.0,,
Probably the worst class I've taken so far. She doesn't use a powerpoint or any visuals. Its the most boring thing you have to sit through. Sure the tests are relatively easy but I'd rather have hard tests and an engaging class. Take someone else if you can.,3.0,3.0,,
"3 Tests and 1 Essay each are worth 25%.    She is not as easy as people say she is.  I have a 3.8GPA.  You have to memorize a lot. Although she gives you the terms to study for, its hard to know how in depth you need to know them. It's easy to get B+, maybe even an A- but like any other classes, A is not as easy as other comments say...",4.0,3.0,,
idk why she is rated as being easy...there is nothing conceptually difficult about this course but the volume is ridiculous especially because your grade is determined by two tests.,1.5,4.0,,
"everyone thought this was going to be an easy a....until the midterm when 21% failed and the average was a 73. unfortunately, your grade is 50% midterm, 50% final. shes pretty odd and the first part of the class is much more depressing than the rest so dont get discouraged. only take this if you will go to EVERY class - only way to pass.",3.0,3.0,,
"this more of advice than a review - make an effort early on to get to know her. she grades 25% of term papers and the papers she grades are of the kids she knows. most people who had her grade their paper got an A, while many of those who were graded by the TA got a D. also follow term book when taking notes.",3.0,2.0,,
"Lectures seem like they take hours but if you either read the textbook or take good notes the tests are easy (all multiple choice). The paper is pretty simple too, just time consuming. She tells you exactly what you need to know for the test too. Some work involved but she makes it pretty easy to get an A",4.0,2.0,,
"Boring professor but very interesting material. Two exams, each with 5 or 6 ids and 2 long essays. She is a very strict grader and wants as many details as you can remember from her lecture.

"Professor Anbinder is a great professor. He definitely likes to give students a hard time and can be rude, but he really knows what he is doing. The class is broken down into 3 exams and 1 essay. If you go to class and pay attention, there is no reason you shouldn't do well.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"3 tests and a final paper. Lectures are great, but he doesn't post lecture slides online, so don't miss class. Tests were graded fairly, but papers are graded hard - he lets you bring your essays to him for feedback before they're due though. Anbinder is retiring at the end of this year, so if you can get into his class semester, do it.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Lectures were interesting, he is clearly very passionate about the subject. He said he has never given more that 2 A's in a semester - this class is easy to pass but not easy to ace. If you want an A you need to read the book but if you're happy with a B+ you can skip them if you go to class. Go to his office hours if you do badly, it helps so much",5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Anbinder's lectures are really interesting as it feels like he's telling a story. I didn't crack a book the whole semester, but was still able to get a B+ because I didn't miss a single class. He doesn't post powerpoints online. 3 exams, 25% of your grade for each and one 7-10 page paper worth 25%. I took the class for the great professor though.",4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
I LOVED this class. His lectures are phenomena!! the Transitions and the topics he covers are flawless. The way the tests are structure ensures that they are both easy and that you are actually learning the info. I learned a monumental amount in this class and loved every minute. Anbinder is so passionate and truly cares about each student,5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"It doesn't matter what class you take with Anbinder, just TAKE it! He is the best professor I have ever had at GW! He gives great feedback on papers, which really helped with my writing. If you need help with anything, just go to his office hours. There is a ton of reading for his classes, but his classes are worth it!",5.0,4.0,, Yes
3 exams and a final paper. His lectures feel like he's telling a story. They are a bit dry but the subject is interesting. DO NOT MISS CLASS. he doesn't post the powerpoints online. I never once opened the book but i went to every class so I was able to get at least a B+. Go to his office hours before exams so he knows you are putting in effort.,4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Anbinder is an incredible professor. He can be a little intimidating at first because he is a straight shooter and doesn't bs his students. However, he's a great lecturer and presents the material in a clear and concise way. DO NOT SKIP CLASS. Information on the lectures will be on the exam. And try to keep up with the readings as well.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Anbinder is a once in a life time prof who will change your life. The books he assigns are interesting and worth the read. The class very hard but he wants his students to do well and is very accessible outside of class. He helps you become an amazing writing and you'll never be bored in class. You're lucky if you get to have a class with him.,5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"This class can change you as a person. Maybe a more stressed out person but a better historian. A class worth taking no matter your major if you're able to put in the time and effort, which it requires a lot of. Of course, there are times when there is slack but don't you dare let your guard down to this class or you'll read 300 pages in one night.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Although history is not my major, I absolutely loved this class. Professor Anbinder really made this class interesting at all points of the civil war. He can grade a bit tough on your exams and paper, but still fair on marks. Very helpful in office hours, highly recommend going to them especially before exams",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"I would recommend Professor Anbinder to anyone who wants to take a history class and really learn. You do have to put the work in if you want the grade, but it isn't too bad. If you don't read, you won't do good on the tests. Attending lecture REALLY helps! If you have any questions, go to his office hours and he'll help you! A very enjoyable class",5.0,4.0,, Yes
Tyler is one of the coolest professors I've ever had and coolest people in general. His class is relatively difficult but he makes himself extremely accessible. You can tell that he wants all of us to succeed. The way he taught made it easy to form connections between everything in the Civil War era and it was highly fascinating. Take his class!!,5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"He's a very solid history professor. His lectures are interesting, and he really does care about his students. No need to read the insane amount he assigns. Just go to class and take good notes and you'll end up with at least a B. The only grades are 3 tests and a paper. Tests aren't as bad as he makes them out to be. Paper is graded fair but harsh",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Tyler knows what he is talking about and is passionate about it. You will learn a lot. However, be prepared to MEMORIZE everything. His tests are basically just spitting words back on a piece of paper. He gives good feedback on papers, though. You can still get a B without reading the assigned books. Shouldn't have taken his as a freshman though.",4.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"I am convinced Tyler is the best professor on campus. His lectures are heavy but he teaches in a way that makes it very interesting. He will also give extension on the one paper for the semester.

"Anbinder is a great professor who has interesting lectures and is extremely passionate about his studies. His office hours are really helpful because he gets to know you better and you can clarify what exactly he's looking for in papers, etc. There's a lot of assigned reading but you don't really need to do it to get a good grade. MUST ATTEND CLASS",5.0,2.0, Mandatory,
"Anbinder is a good professor. Be prepared to read a lot. Also, his tests are where you have to do a lot of writing (IDs and their significance). There are three tests and one paper. Don't skip class. Take notes bc his powerpoint are presented in a way that he'll only have bullet points on the slides if you absolutely need to know them for the test",3.0,4.0,,
"Probably the most knowledgeable scholar on nineteenth century American that GW has to offer. Anbinder knows his Jacksonia, Antebellum, Civil War, Reconstruction, and more like the back of his hand. I've never met a teacher so knowledgeable who takes so much time to care for his students. Be prepared to work, but I'd highly recommend HIST 2312.",4.5,4.0, Not Mandatory,
"Professor Anbinder is a good lecturer.  It is clear he really loves what he teaches, and his interest is inspirational.  However he is an unnecessarily hard grader.  He treats his students like grade school kids requiring them to follow his exact ways for every assignment.  He is helpful outside of class, but he is very curt.  Not exactly friendly.",3.5,4.0,,
"I really enjoyed The Jacksonian Era!! I learned so much about history! There are three essays and a test, as well as weekly discussions on the reading. This class is easy and he posts every powerpoint online. Participation is a grade so talking in the discussions is important. He loves concise essays. He is a quirky dude. making his lectures fun!!",4.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Easy A. Lectures are useless and do not help for tests or essays. Professor Stott is difficult to understand as he rambles and his lectures are very disorganized. The class consists of two essays (the textbook and discussion help a lot for information) and two tests (know the IDs and essay prompts, be specific)",1.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Stott is a super sweet, understanding man who knows a great deal about what he teaches. Lectures can be dry at times and I'll admit I zoned out, but you will still learn a lot. The papers and the two exams were very straightforward, and they are graded by your TA. Do the readings for discussion, it will help.",4.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"I really enjoyed taking both Jacksonian Era and History of the American West with prof Stott. He's a very nice and knowledgeable guy. Participation matters, but like nobody else talks so if you talk 2-3 a class you'll get an A for participation. Paper can be hard but he lets you do optional drafts so just do those. Keep in mind I'm a history major.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"The previous comment calling him a sweet, old man hit the nail on the head. Very nice guy, not very technologically adept, but really cares about his subject and is knowledgeable about it too! If you're looking for an interesting class, that's not very hard, with a professor that cares about his or her subject, take the Jacksonian Era with Stott.",4.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Sweet old man, very knowledgeable. I think this class is very dependent on what TA you have. The exams are super easy; you received a very straightforward study guide and example essay questions. Make sure to write down the IDs on the power point at the beginning of class they will be on the test.",3.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Stott is kind and tries his best, but the class is super disorganized. Each week is 1 lecture/1 reading discussion. he grades easily and tells you exactly what will be on tests so you can very easily prepare. He has you read a lot but you can get away with skipping most readings if you're good at Bs-ing a comment or 2 during each discussion.",3.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Professor Stott is literally the MOST BORING LECTURER IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. His attendance is mandatory which makes this dilemma worse. The paper had zero guidelines which made it VERY hard/confusing. The two exams were not too challenging; however, if you don't write an answer directly as learned from the lecture, you will be deducted points.",2.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"He's a very nice man and willing to help if you ask for it, but he is a harsh grader. The paper for the class requires a lot of outside research and he will mark off if you just rely on class readings. Attendance is mandatory which can be a pain for poorly organized and boring lectures. He does not present historical events chronologically.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"Really vague on the paper so prepare for the worst.  The lectures are EXTREMELY boring but you have to show up. You can make it by with just doing the study guide and preparing the essays.  Honestly, the most boring lecture I've ever sat through. Also, very unhelpful during office hours.",2.0,3.0, Mandatory, No

"Stott is just your average history professor. He's a quirky guy who knows a hell of a lot about everything. Two papers, a midterm, and a final. Not difficult if you do the work. The TAs are pretty helpful, as they are the ones grading you. I recommend if you want an easy class. However, if you don't go to lecture, you won't actually learn much.",3.5,2.0, Mandatory,

"Stott is a very nice professor. This class is remarkably straight forward and easy; your grade is evenly made up of two exams, two papers, and discussion. You hardly need to even read the textbook to get a grade in the A range. Put in a reasonable amount of effort for the papers and study a bit before the exams, and you'll be fine. Take this class!",3.5,1.0,,
I love Professor Stott. He is one of the nicest guys at GW. He stutters a bit but that is easy to overcome. Assignments aren't too bad and he is a ton of help if you ask him. Really nice guy,4.5,2.0,,
"Very boring, but it is a good way to fulfill a requirement. Lecture attendance isn't mandatory but very helpful - he gives IDs that are on the midterm and final. Going to section is a big part of your grade and is really helpful. In general, not a terrible way to fulfill a gcr.",3.0,2.0,,
"This class isn't difficult. It's important to go to the lectures, because Professor Stott gives you the ID's that will be found on the midterm/final.

good teacher,4.0,2.0,,
he is only helpful if u come to him SEVERAL times. not very good at explaining things. seems frusterated when asked questions.,2.0,4.0,,
He is a very bad teacher for the simple fact he doesnt answer in class questions because he says that is a waste of time. The big thing is that he doesnt explain chapters in a way people can understand 75% of the people in my class had no idea what he was talking about and we basically taught ourselves. Me others sent his name to Student Affairs,1.0,5.0,,

he is the WORST! possible professor to take for this class! he doesn't seem to have an interest in trying to help you. he can't teach for anything. he gives you all the homework assignments for the semester but never takes any of it up. it's pointless to atempt the homework because he doesn't explain how to work anything in full.,1.5,4.0,,

This class was hard to begin with and him teaching it didnt help anyone.....enough said.,3.0,3.0,,

I would recommend Mr. Eskew to anyone. He is not a hard teacher. We didnt have homework until halfway through semester and that was just for a week or two and that is all we have had. He is easy and very willing to help you out in any way.,4.5,2.0,,
He is a really awesome teacher.  He knows what he is doing and if you pay attention and take notes you'll be fine.  He rarely gives homework...we din't have any until over halfway through the semester.  The homework was harder than the tests.  It's an all around pretty easy class.,4.5,2.0,,

If you don't, you will fail",4.5,4.0, Mandatory,

I took his course fearing that I may fail again due to my lack of programming experience. I took this class before with another professor but dropped it after 2 weeks because I couldnt keep up.

Prof Campaneau's lectures are very interesting and insightful. I stayed awake for each and every class and was sad when it ended.

Test questions are familiar/easy but think before you answer.,3.5,2.0, Not Mandatory,

Taking 365 is a prereq, also enjoyable, but I would definitely recommend taking the seminars!",4.5,3.0,,
Having a background in human evolution would make this class much easier. He used a lot of advanced terms and scientific names without explaining. I was always confused in lecture.

No tests.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes

Borderline academic dishonesty.",1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No

Unfair grading,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
The course is doable with a different prof. He makes the course 1000 times unbearable and that's not an exaggeration. His handwriting is difficult to read. Two textbooks were made available and yet not enough. He includes so many proofs in midterms and final that he hardly goes over in class. I think he intentionally wants students to fail.,1.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No

I'm convinced there is not a worse professor at BYU. I graduated a year ago and still hold to that. Sometimes I wonder how he can sleep at night. Has anyone told him? Is he aware? Does he care? ...most likely not. I'm interested to know what his peers think of him. Maybe he just treats his students terribly but is a good guy elsewhere?,1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory,
"This was hands down one of my favorite classes i've taken at BYU. I liked the material a lot so that helped, but despite his negative reviews I thought he was an outstanding professor.

SO hard. This class was so hard. But I learned so so so much. He was extremely tough (he's genuinely a really nice guy but has to put on an aggressive front to not get walked all over) but I have never learned more in a class. Definitely go to the last lecture.,5.0,5.0, Mandatory, Yes

This guy was the rudest professor I have ever dealt with. I took his Econ 110 class through independent study and reached out for him once and he told me he was not interested in me as a student. Passive aggressive. Failed an essay because I used an MLA header. Talks down to anyone who questions. Don't step out of line. HW was ridiculous btw.,1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory,
"Professor Kearl is ripping off his students. He requires every student to buy a brand new copy of his textbook.

Kearl is among the rudest professors I have had.",1.0,3.0, Not Mandatory,

* Great Lecturer.
* Tests are sometimes curved.

There is a large curve too.",4.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Rational individuals wouldn't make their decision based on others' reviews. Just take his class! ,5.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

"His class is onerous yet 100% worth taking. I've always loved econ, and if you're like me, I strongly recommend taking ECON 110 from him. That said, his tests are simply impossible(coming from someone who got the highest score on the final). You'll survive if you peruse the textbook multiple times and regularly attend the TA reviews and labs. ",5.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"This class is going to be one of the hardest classes you have, but you learn more in this class than any other. Professor Kearl may seem hard on the outside but he really isn't.

Honestly one of the sweetest professors ever. She really cares about the subject she teaches and she gets you to care about it too.

"Day's recorded lectures are pretty dry but informative and get points across. But his in-person lectures are more hit or miss since he expects the heavy lifting to be done by his recorded ones. 

His tests, assignments and quizzes are challenging but mostly fair since they pull from the textbook.",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Exams were fair, be prepared to read the textbook & memorize every small detail. No need to go to lectures or watch his videos.

bro this class is making me re think being a psychology major. Great start from psyc100 failing almost everything because he doesnt teach! maybe with a lot of self teaching you can get a good mark but not doable when you have other classes too.

He is a great prof. He is one those profs that notice if someone is working hard or not. He is very fair and considerate. I don't remember him doing anything without having a good reason for it.

"Dr. Houck is an extremely interesting person and lecturer. My only gripe about the class is the history of rhetoric paper, in which we had to summarize the history of rhetoric in only one page while fulfilling a bunch of random source requirements. The paper is worth 10% of the grade. Outside of that, the class is very fair and interesting.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes

"Take Dr. Houck if you're at FSU. He's got a reputation for being hard, and it's true, but you actually LEARN in his class. He doesn't just expect you to memorize nonessential theories, but applicable communication lessons. For our class, he gave 16 quizzes, 2 exams, 1 essay, 6 journals, and a group project. It's a lot of work, but 1000% worth it!",5.0,5.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Be prepared to work HARD to make a decent grade in this class. He doesnt fool around. However, this is one of the only courses Ive taken at FSU where I finished feeling like holy cow, that course was insightful. And that makes it worth is. Discussion was always engaging in class and he knows how to form a tight-knit group out of the students.",5.0,4.0,, Yes

"The last lecture I had with Davis was 3 hours long but only had 30 minutes of content related to giving a speech. The other lectures I had with Davis were a similar story.

You will take pride in being one of his ""6%"" who receive an A in this ""uphill sprint.""",3.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"He was one of my favorite professors at FSU. You definitely have to work for your grade, read the material, and going to class is a must if you want to succeed, but it is so worth it.

While in his office, he thanked me for asking dumb questions, asked if there was something wrong with me such as a mental health issue, and when I told him I was withdrawing he said that it was for the best. I studied 20+ hours a week for his class.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No

Doc can be described as a mad scientist. His honors CHEM 111 and 112 classes are NOT like a regular class.

Pretty awful class. He disregards any opinion that isn't his own. If you like theoretical chemistry go for it. If you have any beliefs or religion I would also advise not taking the class. 20 page paper due at the end as well.,2.0,4.0,,
Doc is a great teacher. His job is to teach us about science and he does that extremely well. Very engaging lectures and very helpful.

You're graded on attendance which can be the difference-maker in your grade so if you can't handle her 8 a.m. don't do it. Her class should be speaking intensive because all you do every day is participate and do partner work out of the workbook. I would suggest knowing your Spanish because she'll teach you next to nothing new all year. Sweet lady!,4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
I learned a lot in this class because of the homework and my own input into studying. Class is just about going over the homework. There are no lectures at all. You teach yourself. There are 2 oral presentations and 4 tests and a final. They are hard but fairly graded. Attendance is necessary for participation points. She is funny but tough. Study!,2.0,5.0, Mandatory, No

She gives out grade booster assignments which are not hard and even does extra credit.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"This was by far the easiest Spanish class I have taken. She gives several opportunities for extra credit and drops your lowest quiz grade. Make sure to study the vocab, there's a lot of it. She also takes attendance for a grade so make sure to show up! She was also pretty funny and very understanding.",4.0,2.0, Mandatory,

"I got an A in SPAN-101 and took spanish all throughout high school so I know I'm not bad at spanish.

"Felt very mislead, she came in saying her class was an easy A so I decided to stick with it.  Forget learning anything in class, you and your partner spend half the time learning the directions and rarely get to finish the activity before you're expected to answer aloud.

"She goes pretty fast for a 101 class and starts speaking to you in Spanish pretty much the first day. She makes everyone speak in class;tells you what's exactly on the exam section by section, but the exams can be a bit tricky. You'll definitely need to work in this class, but it'll pay off. She's funny too, so she'll keep the class going.",3.0,3.0,,
She's a pretty decent professor. Class is basically going over exercises from the book. She tells you what will be on each test so if you teach yourself those concepts out of the book you'll do fine. I thought the tests were easier than the class exercises.,2.5,1.0,,

This was a literature class so it was reading heavy. Dra. Lewis gives good feedback and her tests are in essay format. She has small group discussions or assigning a different question to each group of 3-4 and having them explain their answer to the rest of the class. The prerequisite is 202/205 but take 305/306 before this or you will struggle.,4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Don't take this class if you're not a Spanish major. She is very helpful, but the class is still kinda difficult. Whenever you have a question about something, go to her. Make sure to actually read the reading assignment. Half the class consists of small group discussions. Lots of assignments meaning many chances to boost your grade.",4.5,4.0,,
"Her passion for the class is clearly non-existent. It's obvious that she tries to engage her students in the class, but most of the time the readings are way too difficult and unclear that you're unable to participate because you have no idea what she's talking about.",2.5,3.0, Not Mandatory,
"Dr.Lewis was a great 205 Professor. She knew that most the students in the class were taking it for a Gen Ed. Her test are super hard though.

She grades fair and is always helpful!",4.0,3.0,,

You learn SOOOO much from her class!",5.0,3.0,,
"Absolutely terrible instructor. Fails completely to engage the class in the material. She has the class get in small groups to discuss readings rather than discuss them in a class, which is a cop-out on her part as someone with a PhD in Spanish literature. Excruciatingly boring. Don't expect to learn anything from her or this class.",2.5,3.0,,
"Get on her good side and read materials before class and you should be good. She knows who tries and who doesn't and she's not afraid to get on you. Overall, I'd say she's an average professor.

"Professor Lewis is very nice and definitely knows her Spanish, but my class as a whole had trouble following her a lot of the time. Some advice: Study the grammar before coming to class!!!

Luc Bauwens is by far the worst professor I've ever had at UofC. His lectures are next to incoherent ramblings that attempt to describe illegible calculus formulas which are drawn out without explanation. His written slides are filled with logical gaps and inconsistencies. On top of that he plagiarizes midterm questions from textbooks too.,1.0,5.0,, No
"By far the worst professor I've ever had. Horrible lecture notes that are extremely convoluted and full of integral after integral with jargon-filled explanations.

"Unless you have no choice, do not bother taking any classes with Bauwens. You will learn very little, and pass only by memorizing the solutions to previous quizzes and exams.

worst prof in existence,1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No

Stays on the phone with someone while a student is in his office. His final exams are all ""pass the final to pass the course"". You see, this would work if he was actually a good teacher",1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
I believe the only issue with Bauwens is he is too smart. Therefore teaching 3rd year classes is too easy for him and he glosses over things that we would find difficult.. other than that his classes were not that hard and he gave out marks easily if he saw you tried. He was rude to some students but I feel like they deserved it,3.0,4.0,, Yes

Watch out because assignments are not discussed, making it hard to know what he wants.",1.5,5.0,,
He seems to teach on a MBA level. The class I took was not on that level. We had 3 tests and a HUGE A$$ paper.  He'll curve test and takes attendance.,3.0,3.0, Mandatory,
The only flaw is that he wants you to know how smart he is. Otherwise I made an A with reading just the definitions in the book and going to class. Do the practice tests online and take your time with the tests. He curves on tests (so there's at least 1 A) and might curve final grade if you are close. Don't be intimidated and read the book!!!,3.0,3.0,,
Smart professor.  Real strong Italian accent.  I like him because he makes you think outside the box like the real world instead of being told what to do all the time.  Tough class because he really prepares you for the future.  And cares how his students are represented knowledge wise.,3.5,3.0,,

Dr. Malecha is insanely smart and passionate about what he does.

"Dr. Askay seems like a nice person, but he is one of the most unclear profs I have taken. Doesn't seem to know how to work technology so his lectures are very unclear, and he's a slow grader.

No hw besides reading &I never did it and still did well. He means well and he's very smart but he doesn't use moodle or any form of technology so no powerpoints and he rarely emails back. He's not a very clear speaker so you walk away from class knowing as much as you did walking in. Just research for the exams and look @ notes and youll be good.,3.0,3.0, Mandatory, No
Graded off of two midterms and a final essay which consists of two essays. His lectures are helpful. Only used one of the books which was the shorter one since it was more concise and had easier to understand language. Not a tough grader if you show evidence that you know what you're talking about. Given the exam questions ahead of time.,3.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
"If you pay attention in lecture and browse the readings you'll do fine. I didn't read everything required and I ended up with an A in the class.

"He may give you the essay questions for the mid terms/ final, but you still have to do all the readings because his lectures don't make sense. Sometimes the readings are confusing.

"Easy class if you do the study guides. Test questions are given on the first day for the whole semester. Gives great examples and is willing to explain more if needed.

"Easy class, but not the best teacher. If your actually interested in philosophy he may not be for you.

He may just hate teacher ethics though, may be better in eastern philosophy",3.0,1.0,,

However, she lectured the whole class based off of the coursepack and there was very little discussion. She also assigned two extra books which were boring and repetitive and not worth the time reading them. Quizzes tough but only 10% of the grade.",3.0,3.0,,
Fantastic professor. She was so helpfully. Dempsey is brilliant. We covered a lot of material and I learned so much. Take her classes. She is one of the best at UP. I loved the time she gave to me outside of class. Great talks in her office. She is  so good!,5.0,3.0,,
"Took Bib-Trad, and wasn't impressed. She's very knowledgeable about the subjects, but spent so much time in Gen/Ex. (half the semester) that we didn't touch on anything else, even though all the other classes did! She was always late to class, but expected students to be on time. If you actually want to learn about the whole Bible, Don't take her!",3.0,4.0,,
"She had extremely high expectations that were often not articulated clearly.

While she is extremely knowledgable on the subject, I found that she expected us to know much more than we did.",2.5,5.0,,
"I was nervous to take the class because of all the horror stories I have heard about her. She grades pretty hard and you will have to spend quite a bit of time and energy on her assignments.

"Prof. Julka was a fun and kind professor who gave great lectures. Reading the textbook is VERY important for passing the class, as there are three main exams and a final each semester. She gives extra credit to a few students each exam, usually the winners of a Kahoot about the exam topic coming up. She makes class and lectures very enjoyable.",4.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Julka is a caring professor. Lecture had two presentations (you can have a partner), 3 tests, and final. Tests consist of multiple choice, but mostly fill in the blank and short answer/essay.

"Dr. Julka is great. She's highly engaging, and as someone who isn't a Psych major, she kept my interest stimulated. She also gave very reasonable, mostly free-response tests.

"I highly recommend taking PSY214 from Julka. You could absolutely succeed on the exams from the lecture alone, but I did find the textbook to be very helpful for clarification and to study off of. She grades pretty nicely from a variety of in-class labs (so yes, you have to show up), a midterm, a final, and the final research project.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I learned a good amount and her classes are not super hard, just make sure you study well for her tests.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Julka is super nice. You don't really need the book since she lectures straight from the text and her lectures are kind of boring since she only uses a slide projector. There are labs almost every day so if you miss class, you lose 10 points, but she's a lenient grader when it comes to the research project.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Best class I've ever taken -- everyone should take it. Will affect how I live my life. Best professor in every way,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Really, really like Dr. Julka as a person. In fact, I was sort of in awe of her. Unfortunately, I did not do well on her tests at all. I was an A student before her class.

"If you want to learn more than you will from any other professor, take Utlaut. If you want to get a good grade wouldn't recommend him. He will inspire you while he goes off on tangents. We took three tests plus the final. No quizzes. Homework will not prepare you for the tests and he held his office hours during lab. The textbook will be your Bible",5.0,5.0, Mandatory, Yes
"If you're looking for an easy but meaningful science class, take Astronomy with Utlaut. I admit he's kind of intimidating, but his lectures are amazing (and nearly impossible to take notes on). Always speak/write honestly, he's a no-BS guy. This was probably one of the most interesting classes I've taken, with an equally interesting/engaging prof.",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes

"He made his office hours during the lab, so he did not have to talk to us.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
Utlaut expects you to do a lot of work outside of class and go to class with specific questions.  He is good in office hours.  He is a hard ass and don't take the class if you get offended easily. He is very knowledgable about the subject and sometimes goes on tangents but you learn a lot.,4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Don't get me wrong, he can come off as a scary and a hateful guy, but he really cares for his students when you talk to him outside of class - that is, if you actually care about learning. He does push his students, but only so that they can reach their fullest potential. This class itself is hard, so make sure you go to office hours too.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"My favorite professor at UP, he has a huge amount of knowledge that he loves to share and is passionate about it. You won't get to all of the material in class and you have to have questions but a great learning experience",4.5,4.0, Mandatory,
"Very weird class structure. There's no homework, and the syllabus said there wouldn't be any tests, so his final caught me completely off guard. Do not make the same mistake I did, and TAKE NOTES!!!  However, he has a lot of knowledge, and does a good job communicating it.  I just wish I had made my opportunity in his class a better experience.",3.0,3.0, Not Mandatory,
"Make sure you come  to class with questions to ask. Definitely expects you to learn most of the material from text textbook. Very smart man, but can be a jerk.  Although the lectures were interesting, they were too often off topic and didn't fully prepare you for the exams. Expect to go to open lab and learn concepts on your own. ",2.5,4.0,,
"Amazing professor. ""Tangents"" are always relevant.",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory,
"VERY INSIGHTFUL. You must look at the class a different way. Not your typical lecture. It's not ""heres the problem, and heres how to do it"". It is more 'these simple problems effect everything in exsistence, learn to love it'.",3.5,2.0, Mandatory,
"Possibly the worst teacher I have ever had. If you want to learn physics look elsewhere as he will only cover the course material maybe 5% of class. The rest is spent discussing useless tangents which are sometimes interesting but always irrelevant. To pass I had to teach myself physics from a book, so be prepared for hours and hours of extra work.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"Extremely intelligent, and honestly my favorite teacher at UP, I take classes just to have them with him. He goes off on wonderfully intriguing tangents very often, while getting you all the material.",5.0,4.0,,
"Utlaut is very smart; unfortunately, teaching requires more than understanding concepts, it requires the ability to effectively communicate those concepts, Utlaut has zero effectivenes in teaching.  Utlaut is disorganized, obviously does not prep for class, goes off task and is severely lacking in people skills.  Be prepared for independent study.",1.0,3.0,,
Gives lots of interesting tangents and stories. At times he can seem kind of full of himself. Also can seem like a bit of a jerk but he is usually joking. Because he gets off topic frequently and for long amounts of time he often goes through the material very quickly.,2.5,3.0,,
"Utlaut's astronomy class might be the easiest and most interesting course at UP. You never have homework or use the book, there is no final, and students' questions guide the class. There is no reason not to take this class.",5.0,1.0,,
"A very weird man with high intelligence. He know exactly what he is talking about half of the time. I feel that he has done his job but at the same time, acted like he knew how the world revolves, as if it is easy to comprehend everything in class. I did not like having him, but I can respect him as a teacher for what he does.",3.0,5.0,,
"Utlaut is definitely one of the smartest professors in class. His teaching may be different than most because he doesn't just give you equations and to plug numbers in, he explains and shows where they came from and why. You will definitely not be able to grasp everything he explains but I felt as if I learned so much more after taking his classes.",4.5,3.0,,
"Best professor at UP. Knows just about everything there is to know. But be warned, if you take his class, you WILL want to change your major to physics.",5.0,4.0,,
"Utlaut is an interesting teacher, to say the least.  He often talks about things not really related to physics and often just tries to teach you something about life.  This can be really cool or really annoying, depending on how difficult you find physics. Oh, and make sure you show him respect, or else he can be a hard ass.",4.0,2.0,,
"Dr. Deming is easy if you show up and listen! You're only really graded on the midterm, final, and a writing assignment (so easy&short), but if you take good notes during the review session you should be good to go! Also very nice during office hours. I only went once to clarify things for the midterm and he literally told me what I needed to know",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"DO NOT take professor Deming. He has been the worst professor I have had at UP. He is not helpful, rude, dismissive, and makes it clear that his students are below him. I would do everything I could to avoid taking a class with him.",1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"Only really graded by Midterm and final, and if everything is not worded exactly how he wants it he will give you a bad grade. Does not allow individualized thinking in class or on the tests. No power points, nothing on Moodle, the only way he teaches is by talking at you for an hour and a half. won't respond to emails, rude and dismissive.",1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"do not take him for theology 205, you will regret it. all he does is lecture with rarely any powerpoint slides, so you are stuck frantically writing down everything he is saying the whole time. i would love to skip but he gives a quiz at the beginning of each class. he is also rude and dismissive. worst class and professor i have taken at UP so far",1.0,3.0, Mandatory, No
Attendance/quizzes 30% Writing assignment 10% Midterm examination 30% Final examination 30% The quizzes are 1 pt each if you get them correct and -.5 if you miss one.

hes very intelligent and funny BUT his assignment does not make sense so you are bound to get a low grade. His midterm and final seem easy but then you get them back and boom another bad grade. grades very very very hard.,3.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"If you want a dose of genuine academia from a professor whose intellect outshines all others in the department, and who will whip your critical thinking into shape, be brave and take his classes.

"I had Will for my Holocaust Theology course in Salzburg during the summer of 2011. I can see why people don't like him for THE 101, but I thought he was very knowledgeable and his class was actually one of my favorites at UP. There was one presentation and an essay final. Both were easy and I pulled off a B+.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
You should show up to every class as there is a reading quiz at the beginning of each class. Most of his reading quizzes are easy if you do the reading but a few are just plain confusing and he is pretty rude to you if you try and make your case. He often just ignores questions that he thinks are stupid and isn't very friendly or flexible.,4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Deming 's lectures are particularly boring, and he is a super tough grader. I met with him to go over my midterm and he literally told me I was ""mediocre at everything."" Super helpful. There isn't much homework except for daily reading assignments and quizzes on all the readings. Also very unclear on what he expects on exams.",2.0,3.0,, No
"The tests are so tough, you can say what he taught word for word and still not get full credit for them. His paper is nearly impossible, I went in four times to office hours to make sure I was on the right track, which he said I was, and when I got the paper back I completely failed it. He gives a quiz every class and if you can't miss any classes.",1.5,4.0, Mandatory,
This was probably one of my least favorite classes. I felt like his tests were extremely unfair and difficult.  He didn't really have too much homework and there were periodically reading quizzes.  The tests made up most of the grade which made it hard to do well.,3.0,4.0,,
"Appreciated the study guide list of terms before class. Had to meet with a friend in his other section of the course & compare notes to come close to passing on the multiple, multiple choice tests. I liked that because sometimes you could use questions against each other to help you figure out the answer. Paper was not a nightmare like some say.",4.0,3.0,,
"Furious note taking every class as he drones on and on from his notes. Don't ask him to repeat or clarify information, have to go to office hours if you miss something. Multiple multiple choice tests are tricky, but he gives partial credit, so it's really hard to fail or do really well. Grades essay tough, but lets you redo it for a higher grade.",3.0,4.0,,
Never take this class it is impossible. His expectations are incredible and his tests are impossible. Highly advise not having him for a teacher as it is the hardest class I have ever taken. The material in his classes is not on the tests. Overall terrible experience.,2.0,5.0,,
Religion and Politics with him was a mistake. Don't take that as your THEP requirement. Makes you buy 7 books (none are ever necessary to use) and has two in class essays and one paper which he grades with difficulty(very hard to get an A). If you are looking to get a good grade (since its a non-required elective) I would not reccomend this class.,2.5,4.0,,
"Pretty funny guy, tests can be hard as they are multiple choice, but any or none of the options may be correct.  A little confusing, but manageable if you study.  He was more open-minded than I expected and made a religion class at a Catholic school inclusive, informative, and interesting, which in my experience is unusual.",3.5,3.0,,
"His lectures are not what the tests cover. The text books don't cover half the material on the test. His own published book that he makes you buy is usless (Christian chapter is 5 pages mostly pictures). He will find ways to give you a C on the paper, he looks for ways to mark you down and not pass you.",2.0,4.0,,
"He's very academic and gives straightforward lectures which I found conducive to note-taking.  The tests are difficult but there's no reason to not get at least an A- if you study.  Also, he lets you re-do the final paper so if you care, you can do well in this class",4.0,3.0,,
"He is so arrogant. The class is all lecture, which is fine, but the test is designed to trip you up. and the two-page paper is so frustrating--he does not articulate what he wants. I would not recommend this class.",3.0,2.0,,
"She's a lovely person however not overly interesting as a prof. Digresses easily (for long periods of times) and hard to follow occasionally.  Class demands participation and the tutorials are mandatory but useless. It's a boring, self taught class. Shame it's mandatory. Expect lots of readings and all of the exams are based on the readings.",1.5,3.0,,
"I can see how some people may not follow Janice perfectly well as she does have trouble hearing and can digress many times throughout a single lecture.

"He is decent . My only complaint is he will grade homework, give you a zero freely, and sometimes not offer feedback. The HW is used for studying, and you have no way of knowing if you are studying sufficiently. He is there after class if you can met. You're better off asking your classmates for help. Good guy, but don't rely on him.",3.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No

One of the best professors I've had. He's very clear and seems to always have time outside of class to answer any questions. I took Process Control for May term and it was very interesting.

"PLEASE, for your own good, ignore all good comments about this professor. I am sitting in this class right now, and it is def. one of the worst decisions I have made at this school. So boring, never gets across what will be on the test, poor review for midterm and test. In general,class is a brutal chore that should be avoided like the plague.",1.5,4.0,,
I had Prof Shipley as an undergrad. I have since gone onto Grad school and I am working on another masters. This guy is the best. I still laugh at some of the things he said in  class. I took victorian England just to have him again as a teacher. His WWI class was awesome. Take his class!,5.0,3.0,,
Prof. Shipley tells awesome stories and makes things funny and relevant. He's kind of all over the place sometimes but he really knows his stories well and enjoys what he teaches. He's a really interesting person and I have admired him all semester. I wish I could have taken 332 as well!,4.5,4.0,,
i messed up my last rating because i rushed and didnt read the rating system right.  so heres what i meant to put,4.5,3.0,,
"Always phenominally interesting in lectures.  He tells great stories and although people complain about not knowing what is important, he hands out a study guide with important words before the midterm and that helped a lot.   He is the best lecturer i have had so far here.",3.0,3.0,,
"He loves what he teaches, but he's so all over the place you never know what you're supposed to be getting out of the lecture. Also, your grade depends on how the TA grades, not him and he only gives a midterm and a final.",1.5,3.0,,
"The TA for 332 was an idiot.  wasn't around and gave everyone horrible grades on midterm.  shipley can be interesting, but class is very unorganized.  took 325 as well and ended up with a good grade, but both classes were way more stressful than i anticipated.  grades were scaled and decent, but was worried about how well i was doing whole time.",2.0,3.0,,
"Prof Shipley is one of my favorite professors by far. His lectures were always interesting and never dull. The only problem that i had with the class was the TA. He was the worst grader i've ever had and most of the class got d's or worse on the midterm. Shipley scaled the grades ,so everyone i know passed with a B though",4.5,3.0,,
"2 exams determine grade and TA grades them. He graded so unfairly, most people got D's or C's. It might have been a good class had the TA been better. Shipley was nice and scaled a little to help.

"I had Prof. Shipley at UMass 10 years ago. He was a great teacher---funny, informative, helpful, and incredibly knowledgable.

I took 6 of his courses and was never disappointed. Best prof ever!",5.0,3.0,,

"He's retired now so he kinda just does what he wants... I was expecting something different from a junior writing seminar, and I was disappointed.

"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! This is by far the hardest class I've taken. He doesn't post the notes anywhere, he doesn't even write notes you just have to write down everything he says. The midterm average was a 65 and he does nothing to change the final at all, I failed both. I ended up with a B+ but put way too much work to get such a low grade.",2.0,5.0,,
Very good professor. Overall an easy Gen Ed; like a high school american history course. 2 exams worth 60% of grade which are fairly easy. Discussions are worth 40% of grade. Attendence is almost mandatory at lectures because class notes are not on Spark. Take this class for a history gen ed!,5.0,2.0,,
Professor Richards is by far one of the most knowledgeable professors I've ever come across when it comes to history. Very old school style of teaching (no powerpoints) so attendance is the key to success. Can be a little boring at times but I would definitely take the class again.,3.5,2.0,,

"He's a professor. He lectures, and if you pay attention and read the material, then you'll do well.  but if you have his class in the morning, there's a good chance you won't be able to stay awake because he can be very monotone",4.0,3.0,,
Straightforward teaching style. Does not baby students. This class is not for whiners. If you have a genuine interest in early American history he's a very interesting guy. Good lectures. Show up and take good notes and you'll have no problems.,3.5,3.0,,

If you do exactly what he asks, you'll get an A. You have to put some work into it, but it's worth it. He has really great experience and stories too.",5.0,1.0,,

probably had more fun in that class than any other since i came to college.  good prof,3.5,1.0,,
"Best professor I ever had! He's always got funny stories to help you understand and you usually get out of class early. He also likes to use hands on learning once you get past HTM 101. He likes to leave his assingments vague to see what you come up with, but goes easy on the grading.  He does tend to take forever to get things back to you though.",4.5,1.0,,

"Chris is so kind & funny, but sometimes he is a little vague on what he wants.  I had him for a summer class and he had us print off materials instead of buying a book which ROCKED, but upon talking to other students we were always confused on what he wanted for assignments.  He also takes a long time to grade papers, hand them back, or answer Q's",2.5,2.0,,

ok...I'm going to say this is my first class with this guy hes very nice...but what is he talking about? I have no clue. because I'm so bored I came on here. I can tell u this guy will be a very nice teacher but hes not the best at doing it himself. I will probably do well in this class but no thanks to him. I still think hes a good guy.,1.0,1.0,,
"I think he is a really good teacher. He is always helpful when asked a question and he is constantly trying to push ahead on his lesson and teach everything as best as he can, while trying to get the class to participate too.

"Class doesn't start on time. Teacher takes frequent ""lunch breaks"" from class. Disorients easy. Loses focus easy. Seems unfamiliar with typical messages like Password Expiry warnings.

Don Frey is extremely knowledgeable and presents information in a way that is both entertaining and clear. He provides countless examples on the whiteboard and computer for us to follow along with.

One of the worst bio profs.",1.0,3.0,,

"Mike is not the best professor out there, but he is also not the worst.

",1.0,4.0, Mandatory,
"Dr Mike is a great teacher. He is passionate about the material, and goes the extra mile to make lectures fun. Compared to other bio profs, Dr. M emphasizes the need to put in work writing notes, staying on top of materials, and creating guides.

"Dr. Mike is one of the best freshman biology professors here at Tech. He is always very engaging with the class and you can tell he loves what he teaches. He holds review sessions which I have found to be ESSENTIAL to the tests, and the review guides help to reinforce what you know and clarify what you don't so you can review the pre-lecture videos",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Mike is my favorite professor. I found it extremely important to watch the lecture videos outside of class and to take notes because it made learning material easier. Pay attention to what he says in class because normally that is what shows up on tests. I found the work load manageable and the tests straightforward for the most part. ,4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"out of all the bio professors, mike is probably one of the better ones. however, you still need to put in a decent amount of effort to get the grade that you want in his class. his review guides and practice tests were pretty helpful and he did have a few review sessions. lectures were confusing and you had to do most of the learning before class",3.0,4.0, Mandatory, No

My high school biology class saved me because there was a lot of reading and videos to watch outside of class. The lectures just reinforce the content, not necessary teaching. The tests were not to difficult.",4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes

Even if its just to talk :)",1.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Mike was a great professor. His clear intention wasnt to try and trick you, but rather to make you think and expand on ideas.

Review homework, activities, and iClickers.",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

Do Not Take.

Very monotone prof and does not really care whether her students pass or not. Exams are literally based on the textbook and there is no time to write her exams.

Take health psych with a different prof.,1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No

Grading was mainly weekly chapter quizzes and two exams. Total breeze. My fellow students were horrible to her and the TAs with constant complaints about literally everything. I would take some of these ratings with a grain of salt. The lectures and choice of TED talks was interesting. She was always really helpful when I contacted her via email.,4.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Remote learning with Krista was a bad experience. She is not cooperative with her students unless they complain to the department. She is not considerate of others' personal problems.

Treats students like trash.",1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No

Frustrating.",2.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
"The course was unorganized, but the marks came from a bunch of different places which was good. The tests were textbook heavy and very specific questions were asked making them hard. I would not recommend this course as an elective. You have to memorize the textbook to even do descent. Quizzes were mark boosters though.",3.0,4.0,, No
"After reading reviews, I thought I could understand that she sometimes needs time off for her MS. But taking this class is FRUSTRATING! Prof & TAs pass duties off each other, questions not answered. Will inform students last minute abt exams, or addressing concerns. 80% of mark from Connect ($$) & tested on inane facts. Not there to help us learn.",1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
She is a tough grader and not very considerate. This is considering she was not able to come to a lot of our classes (which students pay for) because she was too sick to come to class. Going to lectures are also useless since she basically just reads her slides the entire class.,2.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
Worst professor. Teaches students nothing (& reads off PPT) and then tests on difficult material that was never covered? She does not give clear guidelines to any assignments and then grades hard. Usually students get a letter grade with no feedback. The entire course involved presenting a bio on celebrities and she lectured 5 times in 8mnths.,1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
Steve London is the kindest and most caring professor I have ever had. He is genuine and cares more about you understanding the content. I could not say more kind things about this man.

"Hard to please. Easy to fall asleep in class. It's hard to understand what he is teaching because he will randomly start talking about his self in the middle of a lectures. Exams are are essays about what you learned in class, so you see how this can be a problem",1.5,4.0,,
"He pretends that he's the nicest kindest most open hearted man ever but in order to get a WORD in to him you have to pester him, yelling, chasing him down the hallway.

Extremely boring. Spends half of the class time talking about Service Learning and then goes off on tangents about the actual subject. It is definitely important to go to class for the few notes you will take and the fact that he takes attendance.,2.5,3.0,,
"I admit he's a little boring but he means well.  He's willing to stay with you if you have any questions, but his class has no structure.  I basically listen to him all class. There's never any discussion and I bought a $100 book that I never opened!",3.0,4.0,,

"My ultimate impression of Dr. Manso is that, as a professor, her personality can come off as being very intimidating or even sometimes scary. However, as a person, she is very understanding. I took the blended course and she assigned work at the same time every week which was really nice in order to manage my time better for other classes.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
She offers a lot of work but she's super nice and understanding. She's good about attendance but is flexible with her lesson plans.

Very confusing and stressful course overall, but not impossible.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
Lectures are absolutely terrible grading and homework's are extremely confusing pretty sure she doesn't fully understand how to use black board making things extremely confusing.

Avoid!,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"Somewhat unclear guidelines on graded assignments.

She acts like her class is the only one in the world. Just AWFUL",1.0,4.0,, No
Professor Manso expects her students to understand the materials from the textbook in order to have a discussion about the topic in class.

LOVE prof Hoyt. If you take the time to study for exams using the practice exams provided you will succeed in her class.

Very caring professor and loves to teach. Would 100% take her again. ,5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I absolutely loved Dr.Hoyt! Economics isn't necessarily the most exciting topic, but she makes learning it so enjoyable and I am always looking forward to going to her class. She is so funny and deserves the whole world. Make sure you do go to every class because she does do in class quizzes, which she goes over the answers in each class. ",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes

Highly recommend this professor.,5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Not enough words to describe how amazing this woman is. I guarantee I would not have an A in this course if it wasn't for how entertaining her lectures are.

Take her, best professor I have had.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes

"Professor Hoyt is one of the best professors at UK. The 410 class had us going and working directly with non-profits in the community and conducting economic analysis reports for them. Class time was used as group work to write the paper and get help from Hoyt. The midterm was very hard, but that is the only test/quiz. Hoyt wants to give out As!",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

Gail Hoyt is awesome. Shes very funny and entertaining while still being thorough in lecture. Homework load is pretty light and she gives resources to study for exams. She is SUPER helpful in office hours if you need further explanation. Hard to imagine a better Econ professor.,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"My favorite professor ever. She was very engaging and actually made class fun I really recommend taking her. The homework was a little challenging sometimes, but you get multiple attempts. She curves and has bonus points on exams.",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

This class is very organized and consistent, and Dr. Hoyt is super helpful and caring. Also there are a few easy extra credit opportunities. Miss her already!",5.0,2.0,, Yes
"He's overall pretty friendly, just super tough when grading.

He's also not great at communicating outside of class so beware of that!",2.0,4.0, Mandatory,
"I know a lot of people who did not like Dr. Hertog's class, but I genuinely enjoyed it. I admit he can be a little monotonous and certain lectures were more interesting than others, but he cares about your learning and wants you to pass. There is quite a bit of writing in this class, but it is not hard and comes straight from the notes.",4.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes

"the final exam was unnecessarily difficult and was weighted HEAVILY. especially in a pandemic, youd expect professors to provide some leniency for their students. you can try your best, but sometimes your best isnt enough because Dr. Hertogs grading style is more detail-focused, as opposed to acknowledging your understanding of the concept.",1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
Attendance is mandotory and he will count you absent if you are even a second late. Tests were pretty difficult and involved memorizing lots of definitions. He also assigned a group project and final exam due on the same day.,2.0,4.0, Mandatory,
Lectures seem long and boring. He'll mark you tardy if you come in at exactly 10 (or whenever your class starts). Tests are very hard and confusing. The tests are basically memorizing long definitions from the text book. I dread going to his class.,2.0,4.0, Mandatory,
"He's great! So nice and helpful. And if he likes your class, he invites everyone to his house for food. It was delicious.",4.5,4.0,,
"He is the worst professor ever! Do not take him unless you have to. Once he literally gave us a paper that was due that next week, on the same day he had the midterm exam. He does not know what he is talking about, and he never provides you with any of the readings he wants you to do online. He is confusing and has no clue what he is talking about!",1.0,4.0,,
Very tough professor but knows what he is talking about.,3.5,5.0,,
"Worst I've had yet. Awkward and gives lectures that have nothing to do with the homework, which takes Herculean effort to get through for each assignment. You essentially have to teach yourself everything. Totally not recommended unless you're a TEL/MAS major and have to take this class.",1.5,5.0,,
"Absolutely worst teacher I have had at UK. It is almost if he prides himself on confusing students. Tests are insanely hard, unless you are good at memorizing 125 terms and writing their definitions in a 50 minute class period. Unfortunately if you are a TEL major you have to take this class. If not, DONT TAKE IT!!!",1.0,5.0,,
"BORING! Reads off ppt every class. Treats you like an idiot when you ask a question. Study guides are misleading (if it says 30% old material..it really means 70%!)Scatterbrained.

"Getting through Hertogs class is an adventure that you will be happy when its done.  Hes not a bad teacher, but trust me, If you want to make a good grade you will have to WORK for it.  i learned a lot in 300 but i have to say it was hard, and i wouldnt want to do it again.  Also, go bowling with him hes really good and will whoop your ass",3.5,4.0,,
"Don't listen to the Hertog-bashers.  He's a good teacher and a good guy who knows what he's talking about and who's full of interesting anecdotes.  People are just taking out the fact that they don't like Telecom Research Methods as a subject on him.  Furthermore, he's like amiable uncle!",5.0,2.0,,
very vague and unorganized for a person who's job is univeristy research study. Cannot answer a question in less than 1000 words.,2.0,4.0,,
Awful! I learned a lot in the class because I had to read every word of the whole book to do well on the exam.,1.0,4.0,,
The most useful PSYCH research course I have taken. Professor Dixon is an incredible professor. He is always willing to assist students when needed and is extremely friendly. I had a great time in his class. Highly recommend!,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
PSYCH 392 was the single most useful psych course I took and Dr. Dixon was a fantastic professor. He is extremely knowledgeable and will always go out of his way to help.,5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
Amazing professor! Is very helpful and will come in outside of class to work with you on your assignments and class work. Extremely easy course if you actually pay attention and follow his instructions. Most people are able to get a high 90 if they try and don't make any silly mistakes (which can cost you!). PS NO TEXTBOOK,4.5,2.0, Mandatory,

"This was an easy class if you have a science background. Mike is a great prof that really cares about his students. There was a ton of free marks in the class (10%) and the midterms and final were easy if you studied. Too bad he won't be lecturing anymore, he got promoted... :(",5.0,1.0,,

Dr. Besner's teaching style may be gruff and a bit confrontational but his intent is to challenge students to think for themselves. He wants you to give it a try and then he steps in to elaborate. It's not for everyone but if you're up to the task you'll learn a lot from him.,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"avoid if ego fragile (even better, avoid university). if u want to be challenged and learn what research is about this course is for you. tough love by someone who actually cares if you look below the gruffness",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Fantastic professor. Very dedicated to his research and genuinely wants to see his students reach their full potential. Although he enjoys playing the bad guy, by challenging you beyond belief, but if you could learn not to take things to heart, he really lets you grow! I found his tests wordy, you must read it a few times, but super easy MC.",3.5,1.0, Mandatory,
"Presentations & interesting discussions.  BUT, speak before being asked to show you are ""following along"", or a zero for participation will be assigned regardless you've engaged in discussions during seminar and are all subjective marking by the professor If email at the end of term for grade issues, from the third email you will be ignored",3.0,3.0, Not Mandatory,
"VERY polarizing. Don't take a big lecture with him-take a seminar course. You can't have a thin skin with him, but if you're tougher, you'll probably feel like the course is very worthwhile. A tough-love kind of prof. He's helpful in a answer-your-question-with-another-question way. Whether you enjoy the course depends on how fragile your ego is.",4.5,3.0, Mandatory,
"He's very engaging - always asking random students questions to ensure they understand. He knows his stuff, and is a large part of the research discussed in the course. Great grading scheme for the course (just weekly quizzes, and SONA). The course itself is sometimes a bit dull though.",4.5,3.0,,
"Great prof!! You do have to get used to his way of interacting with you. If you're not comfortable with him calling on you in class, let him know. He'll respect that, as much as he encourages students participating and asking questions. Really helpful in office hours. No excuse for a low grade except laziness.",5.0,3.0,,

"The most propitious course I've ever taken in my 4 year university career. Dr. Besner may come off as blunt at times, but his suggestions are always warranted, and are very beneficial. His anecdotes and personal experiences were highly educational and entertaining. Highly recommend that you take at least one course with him! Very knowledgeable!",4.5,2.0,,
"amazing prof.every negative comment is not warranted, every positive explanation is correct. likely much better in seminars (this was) as you do need to get to know him.NOT a bully, just sarcastic, means well.he does mumble,how is that his fault ? tell him! seminars as should be-students teach each other, prof supervises!",4.5,4.0,,
"15 min. Quizzes every other week. Five 1pg. papers. 1 small presentation.Easy. People mistake his teasing as belittling students, but really it's all harmless fun and funny.He is intimidating at first,but soon I began to appreciate his blunt no B.S. way of speaking. He's not afraid to tell you you're wrong and why, and he only does it to help you.",4.0,3.0,,
Great course - Great Prof.  Honestly I don't understand some of the negative comments.  He always promptly answered e-mails.  Weekly quizes reinforced material.  Straightforward class.  And NO TEXTBOOK!!!  Sometimes though he speaks a little bit lowly so if you have a difficult hearing just move closer (Even still - I sat at the back and did fine),5.0,1.0,,
"I felt that teaching was not something he wanted to do, he did it so that he could complete his research.  He was cold and uncaring with the students.",1.0,4.0,,
challenging. wound up thinking that I better understand what research is all about.,4.0,4.0, Mandatory,
"knowledgeable, seems hardcore - but his tests are not.",2.5,3.0,,
"Dr. Besner's style of teaching is less spoon feeding and more challenge. His explinations aren't the best, but they leave you thinking. He admits he has a habit of speaking softly and asks students to point it out, nobody does, then they get mad about it",3.0,4.0,,
"he is supposed to be a cognitive psych professor at the most highly ranked univeristy in the country and yet he can't explain anything worth a damn and can't get information into his student's memory, isn't that what the study of cognitive psych is?",1.0,3.0,,

"Test questions are written like riddles and it's as if she wants her students to fail. I don't know anyone that did well on our major assignment.

Not an easy prof at all",1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory,
Insensitive and ridiculous - setting students up to fail - makes us right a paper critiquing her own study that is awful but if we actaully say somethings wrong with it we get a bad mark,1.0,4.0,, No

"I think the other reviews are a bit harsh. Professor Rye is not that bad and I found the course very good and interesting. The lecture MP4 videos are useful and the readings are not too long. The tests can be a bit difficult, but you can definitely do well if you study well. Don't avoid this class just because of the prof rating!",3.0,3.0,, Yes
Would not take her classes ever again. Her lectures are all over the place and her tests make no sense.

The material is great and totally interesting but not with her.,1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
"REALLY tough grader, and the tests are insanely difficult. I wasn't expecting this class to be biology heavy. On written assignments she'll deduct marks for every mistake, rather than once for the same kind of mistake. She's also incredibly disorganized. On the 3rd test and she was testing us on articles that weren't assigned to us.",1.0,5.0,, No
"Plenty of care is taken when creating accessible lectures. While the slideshows have little written content, the voice-overs are extremely thorough.

My saving grace this term.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Bj rye will say a test is based on chapters in txtb. But 75% of the test is her poorly constructed, messy slides. Poor communication!! Bj's slides are messy, hard to follow, poorly labelled and organized. Where do her lessons begin and end? Bj Rye does not use proper rubrics, but grades harshly; making the grades feel subjective to her opinion.��",1.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
The workload reflects that this is a university course. Dr. Rye uses exams that are difficult to pass if you haven't studied. In a lecture she used to use the N word to form an example. She apologized publicly when confronted and immediately updated the lecture. She does teach from outside the textbook since no textbook is comprehensive.,5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes

extremely difficult tests,1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
prepare to be tested on two completely different criteriums: the text and the lectures. They are extremely different from each other that it feels like taking 2 classes in one. Her all focus is to make the material as confusing as possible. She wants you to read all the chapters and memorize lectures even if she is not going to test you on it.,1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"Really good teacher, very lecture and content heavy, difficult texts, but very interesting if you are engaged in discussion.",4.0,5.0, Mandatory, Yes
"This class ruined my entire semester because I went through it thinking I was going to fail despite trying everything I could. The final exam was worth 55% and was cumulative, adding extra stress to your life if you didn't do well in the midterms worth 20% or more.

"Inconsiderate loud teacher who talks with the TA's loudly during exams. Hypocritical teacher who supports focus in class, but picks up a phone and talks on the way out during exams.

"The content may be interesting but is not worth the horrible grade. I usually get 90's. Tests are too hard. May be easier if you have a science background.

It would be more enjoyable if it wasn't so hard.",2.5,5.0, Mandatory,
Tortures students with work and boasts about it. No phones allowed in lectures. Kicks you out if you use your laptop for anything other than notes.  Lack of knowledge and biased opinions. Admits she is too lazy to update new slides online. Bosses around and judges students. Questioning her leads to her arguing irrationally so as to ridicule you.  ,2.5,4.0, Not Mandatory,
"BJ is a great person, but a terrible professor. She doesn't like marking so she leaves that to her TAs who take forever (handed in assignment in October, the final is in 2 days and still no mark).

He is amazing! Be careful though when he says that he wants a concise definition he is lying you should expand and say everything you know on the subject of the word he wants you to define and not just give the definition he gave in class.

Go to class though!",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes

Wouldn't recommend missing class, since there is a lack of textbook.",4.5,3.0,,

"Most interesting class I've ever taken. Brilliant professor, exciting lectures. The midterm and final were not quite as fun however, be warned that his exams are tough and tricky. Every bit of material is up for grabs, and he manages to question you on all of it. Worth it if you are interested.",5.0,5.0,,

Extremely knowledgeable and clearly passionate about the topic. Lectures can be long and repetitive but that's because Mumby takes his time to elaborate on difficult concepts for students to understand. Exams are only short and long answer questions. You have to be very knowledgeable and provide examples. Overall would recommend his course.,5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Take this professor! He's a very wise and down-to-earth person. You can tell he's an expert in his field.

"I just had Prof. Mumby for 451. I wasn't sure about the class initially, but Dr. Mumby loves neuro and he makes his students interested in it too.

If you can take him do it!",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"As an online class: His exams aren't that hard (using the textbook and notes). He's very engaged with his students and will answer any questions you have.

"all around amazing prof, so understanding and knowledgeable",5.0,3.0,, Yes
"One of the BEST profs at ConU. The course is easy, but what makes him great is how he tests our knowledge. His exams consist of 5 questions (200-500 words/answer), that allow students to explain what they know about the concept & list relevant examples. This is a much more effective way to test learning than those standard multiple-choice tests.",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Great prof. His exams aren't super hard, just 5-6 long answer questions, which sounds scary, but there are lots of way you can answer the questions.

"Mumby is THE most amazing teacher I've had in Concordia. He is really passionate about the class and will do everything in his power to help you.

Great proff despite the fact that I didn't do so well in either of his classes. Both 457 and 467 were very interesting. You must be very detailed in your short /long answers and make sure to read the questions very carefully. The textbook wasnt too important as I read the 150 pages and got worse on test than someone who didn't,3.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dave is a great person in general, he's funny and likes telling little stories. He's passionate about the courses he teaches, and is very accessible outside and inside of class.

"He is an amazing teacher. It was 2 midterms and 1 final which were only short and long answers. It migth be scary at first but as long as you read the book, knows the concepts and examples for each it is really easy to get a good grade. He is really funny and passionate about his course! Super accessible outside of class I fully recommend him!",5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
I took this class two semesters ago and it was one of my favourites! Dr. Mumby was knowledgeable about the papers he assigned and made the material interesting. He was very sympathetic towards students and all around seemed like a bro. Class is easy if you read the papers ahead of time and attend. Simple as that.,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I really love this guy. He knows his subject matter very well and is clearly passionate about it and make the class fun.

"I don't know why people only gave her 1.8 - this teacher is adorable! She is an expert in neuropsychology, her exams are really fair and she always tries to make classes more interesting for us, for instance by blending examples from the news.

Please, please, please retire!",1.5,5.0,,

"Also had him for AFM 482. Worst prof ever. Has tenure so no matter how bad his teaching is, students won't be heard. Lectures and textbooks are useless. Midterms and finals are amazingly hard. Final was was bell curved by 20%. Horrible teacher. Please retire.",1.0,5.0,,
Russell was interesting during the first class when we got to know him. Since then it was downhill from there. Flips through slides quickly making time to talk about gibberish. Textbook + slides + assignments = useless for the exams. Avoid him the old man at all costs.,1.5,4.0,,
"Funny guy, but his teaching ability leaves much to be desired. Assumes students know the information and rapidly flips through slides (leaving us lost), assigns participation grades almost randomly (ppl who don't show up get 8/10?), and his exams are pretty unrepresentative of class work.

Great guy! Corny jokes but how can you not love this guy. He really cares about his students! tough to make material interesting but he does his best. Watch out for midterm though! Fair marker - bell-curved midterm. But after midterm gets much easier.,4.5,4.0,,
"Stark absolutely does not care about the material. He puts no effort into teaching and going to his office hours are useless. The class itself is a bore and his lectures are incoherent.

"HARD.  Final was curved due to number of failures.  You can get 100s on all the homework and still fail this course.

Go to the SLC!",3.5,1.0,,
"As an online professor, horrible. Very rude and condescending when answering students' questions, and will reduce grades if he is e-mailed directly.

"The summer online version of stat was interesting - homework is long and hard but it's not too bad with a study group and help from the GSIs in the online chatroom.

BORING. And in all honestly usueless.Get ready to memorize a whole bunch of peoples names and some random book they wrote. You learn nothing about the actual religions that you wouldnt know already. Very History like...and tends not to ask revelant questions. Relatively easy if youre really good @ memorizing but pointless..highscl RS was better!,2.5,3.0,,

Take lots of notes too.",3.0,4.0, Mandatory,

Good luck. ",2.0,4.0,,

Seriously.",1.5,4.0,,

"Worst class I've taken so far. There's no real problem with the material, but Ryan himself does not care about his students. If you attempt to contribute in class he will talk over you.

"Taken for Calc II: Dr. Glunt is a very laid-back professor. He assigns homework problems but they are not mandatory (but suggested, so that you understand the material). At the end of most weeks, he gives a 5-question take-home test. He always offers to go over any homework or test questions that may be unclear and is a very fair grader.",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

If you've ever read Tuesday's with Morrie? He's Morrie. He is my favorite professor because he is so entertaining and so understanding.

"SUPER easy!  You only have 2 exams and 2 short papers, so you must to well.  However, he grades the papers easily, and he reads the exams to you the day before and you get to have a notecard to use on the test.

This is a wonderful professor. I remember the first day we listened to Buckcherry to try and hear the different instruments. Attendance is mandatory.

the only bad thing about massinon is attendance is MANDATORY. he is SO EASY though. you just sit there and listen to him talk. you only have to go to 1 concert and you get a 100 just for going. he gives you the midterm/final questions before it and you can write the answers on a note card and bring it to the test.,5.0,1.0,,
"this class is so easy. you lose a letter grade for not showing up, but if you email him he, he pretty much accepts anything as an excuse. he's nice, pretty chill, super random. easy class tells you everything that will be on the exam; and only requires one concert review, and an album review. thats it.",4.5,1.0,,

Smart guy when it comes to Biology and a funny sense of humor.  Didn't really expect it from him.  But he teaches you what you need to know and gives you enough material to practice in order to pass the test.  Also goes over whats on your quiz before you take it (including practice problems!!!).,4.0,3.0,,
"Alright class, difficicult if your chemistry is not your cup of tea. He knows alot but sometimes its too much, and moves way to fast. He expects you to learn a chapter within in just one or two days. I recommend taking another teacher unless you want a challenge.",2.5,4.0,,

"First semester was not too bad. Second semester was one of the toughest classes i've ever taken. Grading policy sucked. The tests were worth A LOT. Read over your notes every night and read the new material in advance. Start studying a week before all tests. If you do all of that, you might end up with a B. Very good teacher who really mastered Che",4.5,5.0,,
"I LOVE DR. FOOTE. His class is very difficult but if you study a little bit each day and a lot before tests, you will do fine. Take good notes and use the book to accompany your learning. Doesn't use boring Powerpoint lectures. The only thing that sucks bout his class is the grading! only 23Qs on each test. However he really knows his stuff!",4.0,4.0,,
"Dr.Foote is a professor that you grow to love~  the first days of class you are like,  oh my gosh! What have I gotten into, but then you settle into the groove and you realize how well he actually explains the material.  He is a great professor and I would recommend him to anyone.",4.5,3.0,,
"he is the best professor i have seen who has very good knowledge of chemistry. He is not one of the professor who just teaches off the book but he explains it clearly in his own words. The test are little difficult but if u study notes and little from the book, u will be alright.",5.0,3.0,,
Impossible to study for his tests.  Class has no organization or resources for help.  Impossible to do well unless you already know about chemistry to begin with.,4.0,5.0,,
I cannot believe Professor Wallace is still teaching!  I had her for several classes in the 1970s and loved every class I took.  I still remember things that we did in class and for class and feel that she gave me a good background that really helped once I began a teaching career.  I'm glad to see she is still imparting her wisdom!,4.0,3.0,,

I loved professor Jarret! He was so helpful and gave great feedback!,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Professor Jarret is the reason why I'm a chem major. He's the most intelligent understanding prof I've ever had. I took his course for Orgo I and II, with half a sem in person and the rest online. He tries so hard to make sure everyone is keeping up with the content. SUPER accessible during all hours. Work hard and you WILL pass!! 1:B+ 2:A-",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Great overall teacher. It was definitely a lot of work, put Prof. Jarret makes it super manageable. Always available for office hours. During zoom he'd cold call on everyone to review the video lectures. Was a little anxious at first but it really made me review the material beforehand and not fall behind",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
Professor Jarret is one of the best Professors at Holy Cross. He genuinely cares about his students and provides the material in a well thought out way. Definitely take him if you have the chance!! He makes orgo less scary and actually interesting! His exams are straight forward and he is very helpful in making it easy for his students to prepare.,5.0,3.0,, Yes

"Prof. Jarret was by far the best professor I have had and will have. ORGO is a tough subject no matter who your professor is, but he is the best prof to have teach it. Hes always encouraging and helpful inside and outside of class to make sure you understand the material. He genuinely cares about his students and how they do. Take his class!",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"He expects a lot from students but goes above and beyond to try and help us learn the material both inside and outside of class. If you're struggling, he's super helpful in office hours and accommodating if you can't make the hours he already has. 10/10 would recommend!",5.0,4.0,, Yes

"Jarret is easily the best teacher I've ever had in my entire life. He's very helpful in office hours and is very clear during lectures.

Don't pass up on the opportunity to take him",5.0,3.0,,

"His Tufts Summer class was as much of a pleasure as it was very difficult. He does not skim over anything to make the course easier in the six week course. We got the whole syllabus.

"Dr. Copley is a super nice guy overall. He def holds his students to high standards, this class isn't easy. Lectures were pdfs, weekly discussion/lab recitation with an in class worksheet (for points) and a weekly optional 45 min live lecture. Exams were only an hour long which was the worst for me. No assignments from the book.",4.0,4.0,, Yes
"Lectures were non-video, just pdf documents which kinda stinks but does provide youtube videos to watch. Graded by weekly homework assignments, bi-weekly labs, zoom worksheets, and exams. Exams were kinda difficult as he only gives you an hour to do it but they were open note/book. Homework was the hardest part in my opinion even harder than exams.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"He was ok before quarantine. I had b-. But during quarantine, he did the next exam totally different with 50 multiple choice for 30 minutes. Not practical. Failed class right after failing exam. He's not worth it. His teaching, communication and empathy sucks so much. Never dealt with a teacher like this before. I shouldn't have to retake the class",1.0,1.0, Mandatory, No
"I have never worked so hard and broken down so many times than in this class... but I would do it again. HW is a lot- take it srsly bc it will help on exams. Book is blah- supplement with KhanAcademy. Utilize tutoring services and OHs. You meet a lot of profs who become jaded about teaching, but Copely is an exception. You WILL learn physics here!",5.0,5.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Probably the toughest professor I took at Sac City, but I respect him. As an engineering major, I appreciate how he sets this class at a certain standard. I learned a lot from Dr Copely. I took an easy prof for PHYS420 and I didn't learn anything. I tried for my hardest B's in college but I can say he had taught me the most.",4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
The training wheeles are off. hope you did well in Calc III you will need it for Gauses Law in the begining of the semester he flyes through it. I talked to a lot of other students and they dont like him,1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Contrary to what many people say, Copely's tests and quizes DO follow what he gives in lecture and HW. I was part of the class that did every HW problem and attended every class and I was pleasantly surprised every quiz. Sure the HW takes some time, but its expected of higher level classes. Copely is probably the best physics prof at Sac City.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"He bases exams after discussion work, and the final off of past exams and grades them very fairly. The only reason you wouldn't do well in this class is if you never pay attention to lectures, or never go to discussions. I really enjoyed this professor and would recommend him.",5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"I took Copely for both physics 410 and 420, and wish I could have taken him again. He has energy and is passionate about the subject. He is very friendly and approachable and really tries to assist students. He is a generous grader and that really helped my grade since I usually understood the material but messed up the answer",5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Does not prepare students adequately for tests. He says the quizes are dirrectly from the homework but they aren't, some of the problem weren't even for the lecure or textbook. He says ""some you will familliar with and some you wont be familliar with"". Then talks down to the class about failing it.",1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"Lectures dont explane anything more than the textbook. Homework consumes all of your time, so no time to review and the quizes are very. He talks down to the class like we are all lazy students who must not have studied. Other students have told me going to his office is a waste of time. I get some help out of it, but still fail but the quizes.",1.0,3.0,, No
Copely is a nice guy but he doesnt seem to convey any interest in helping you succeed. His teaching style works for a very small subset of people and if you arent one of those people then you will need to look elsewhere for help. He says he is always available in office hours but seems to get impatient and rushes people out.,2.0,5.0,, No
"Avoid this professor. His lectures are fast and not clear. His exams are very difficult. He writes his own HW problems, and does not use the textbook.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"His lectures are amazing, very helpful & inspiring. The hw isn't collected, but pretend it's being graded for accuracy or you won't do well on the biweekly quizzes. Carefully re-read every example in the book, the hw, & the discussions prior to each test. Don't take it with 10 additional units of 400 series math/science courses: you won't get an A.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"His teaching makes you excited about physics & is very clear. But there are mistakes in the textbook answer key & he forgets he didn't assign reading. I got an A by going to office hours weekly then re-reading every example in the book, homework assignment, & discussion notes before every test, & memorizing all the week's formulas for the quizzes.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Copely  is heavy on integration techniques and expects you to be able to derive a specific equation given little information, however, this makes you understand the material on a deeper level. He is willing to help outside of class and if you pay attention in class and actually work on the homework the class wont be too hard. Lab att. is mandatory",4.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
There is barely any homework in the class and your entire grade is based off 3 midterms and a final. Do not take this class unless you really do feel like spending a large portion of your time studying. But if you take good notes and pay attention to the syllabus you will do well.,4.0,4.0,, Yes
"I got an A by re-doing from scratch every homework assignment, every reading assignment, and every discussion assignment that was fair game for the test before every test and making sure I 100% understood every problem and reading assignment the first time too. That's pretty much what you have to do for an A. The reading is hard. Also, VERY fun :)",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
I got a hard-earned A. His discussions are much more helpful than his lectures to prepare you for his VERY difficult exams. My study method helped me a lot: I picked out the hardest exercise problems I could find in the textbook to try to solve them. I highly recommend using the solutions manual for aid.,5.0,5.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Pretty good professor, but hard as hell. There's no BSing this class. Do your homework, do the reading, study your ass off for tests. His labs and discussions are a piece of cake, so you don't need to sweat those.",3.0,5.0, Not Mandatory,
"Kristina Casper Denman is a nice professor. I recommend her as a professor for anthropology. I took this class for credit. Every week You will have the same assignment. Reading, and then you will have to write what you learned in this article, the articles were interesting and I learned some interesting stuff. ",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"One of the easiest classes I've ever taken. The assignment is the same every week. You answer a question she posts on the discussion board and then read an article and write like a half-page response. No tests, no finals, no projects, no textbook. If you need a class for the multicultural requirement, take this one. I learned so much in this class.",5.0,1.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I wish I could take her again! Despite requiring little work, I really feel like I learned a lot. Class consisted of her posting lecture notes, participate in a discussion board, and read an article the Professor posted, following an assignment on it. No quizzes, no tests. This class was really easy and she really cares about your learning.",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Prof. C-D is an amazing person and an equally amazing teacher. She truly cares for her students and is genuinely interested in teaching. She provides great feedback and responds to emails almost immediately. ,5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

"Easiest professor you could take for ANTH 300. Every week there is just an article, which you read then write a short reflection about; and a discussion.

Honestly, no way or reason to fail her class.",5.0,1.0,, Yes

"The best teacher ever! Loved the way she was organized with the assignments, grading, and discussions. Mrs. C-D is a professor that loves and knows her subject really well. Take her if you can, you wont be disappointed. She cares about everyone to pass this class and she is always available to answer any questions.",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

The work load is great and the method which professor Kristina teaches is very effective and you will feel it while being at her class.,5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"I strongly disagree with those who said that she is not a good professor. We are already done with ANTH 300 and it was the best class in ANTH I saw. We had very easy assignments three paragraphs, the first two with three sentences minimum each and just 5 vocabulary words+ 1 discussion each week. These students wants to sleep and get an A! amazing!",5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
She is a very picky grader and does not care if English is not your first language. She does not emphasize what she wants on the assignments specifically and really cannot take criticism back when you tell her to explain things. Maybe she is bad online because she has such high ratings here. I suggest taking her in person rather than online.,1.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No
The worst for online. She is not a good professor for online courses. We are barely halfway through the semester and we don't know anything STILL. The first exam requires you know the bones BUT THE NOTES AND TEXTBOOK DOES NOT SHOW US. She is very critical and criticizes a lot of your work but can't take criticism back. Anth 300 shouldnt be hard lol,1.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
"I took her class last semester. She is so picky. She actually doesn't care if you have a lot of classes or not or if English is not your first language. She only cares about her lectures and if by any chance you missed to put a comma (,) in your writing then she won't give you the full credit for that assignment. I strongly do not recommend her.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
Great class notes and great articles that we had to read for homework assignments.,5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
She is a great professor. This class is an easy pass. She literally gives you an article to write an essay on. Its super simple. Do not take this class if you have not taken English 300.

Would take again.",4.0,1.0, Mandatory, Yes
"From the start, Mr. Barnum was very unprofessional and condescending. He stated that every student sucks and isn't an artist in the first class, ""just there to fulfill credit."" The whole semester consisted of ""warm-ups"" and 2 projects that lacked concise grading criteria. His phone constantly rings in class and he rarely is in the classroom.",1.0,1.0, Mandatory, No
"Since it's an art class, all of the grades are subjective, which makes it really difficult. If you put in a lot of effort and learn what he looks for, you should do pretty well.

I hate art but he's been my favorite professor so far, he understands that most of his students aren't art majors.",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"You will learn a lot in this class. Barnum is a funny guy who cares about your improvement and wants to help you succeed. He starts off as a difficult grader but eases up during the semester. There are 4 big projects and small drawings you turn in daily, so attendance is mandatory or your grade will suffer. I really enjoyed taking this class.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
Walked into this class LOVING art and watercolor. Walked out never wanting to pick up a paintbrush ever again. Swears so much it's uncomfortable and awkward.

"Dr Young was an alright professor but he is very vague on assignments. There is only a few non comprehensive exams, but if you take good notes, you will do good, He adds a 10-12 curve on each exam, so that the good thing. Very vague on what he wants on the projects, but he is willing to help if asked. Very monotone, so it is hard to stay awake.",2.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Dr. Young is a good professor. You show up to class, he lectures the material, great. The tests on the other hand, are 20 percent lecture 15 percent movies and 65 percent book.

He does curve his tests.",3.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"if there's one thing i would do different in this class, i would read the book and not just take notes. some tests are more centered on it, so if you don't read it you fail. plus its interesting! the tests are kinda hard but if you thoroughly study you should be ok. wont hesitate to explain a topic if you ask. doesn't give extra credit so be wary.",3.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes

"A little monotonous and his humor is somewhat dry, but I love this man. READ THE BOOK AND SHOW UP FOR CLASS. The book is actually really interesting. The classes aren't even that long, and you won't pass if you don't attend; class average on tests were always like 60 bc people didn't bother to show up.

I was wrong, go ahead and read the required chapters as well as memorize the name of the authors who write articles in the book. It is a difficult test, easy course.  ",5.0,5.0, Mandatory,
Read the required material.. take thorough notes in class. I would bring a laptop instead of trying to write everything down. It's just less painful. I easily made an A and I'm not even required to take any sociology classes for my major. I just take his classes as a GPA boost.,4.5,2.0, Mandatory,
Class lecture were great.  Test hard,5.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"Very funny, the lectures were interesting. He does have a dry lecture style but I did not find it boring at all.

"Funny guy. All you do is copy his powerpoints in class, but he throws in funny stories/movies to keep it interesting. skim the reading. he asks the most random questions about the reading on the test. multiple choice test. but not too hard as long as you show up and study a decent amount",3.5,2.0,,
Interesting class but the tests are HARD! Both books are super boring too.,2.5,4.0,,

"This class is very confusing. Her lectures and handouts are hard to follow even after asking questions for clarification. Don't expect to contact her over email, she doesn't check it.

Does not answer e-mails. Doesn't make any sense. Worst professor I've ever had. The tests were easy - just go by the text. She is willing to meet outside of class and try to help but she's still confusing. She will show your work on the projector and make fun of it. She's very sassy and a little rude. Don't take her. Also wasn't interesting at all.,1.0,5.0,,

"Did not understand a word she spoke in this class. The book is the only thing that saves you in  this class.

I could not even help myself from falling asleep.",1.0,5.0,,
"Nice lady, but really bad teacher. Taking a social stats class and have yet to do any problem solving that clearly shows what steps to follow. Not a good math teacher. DO NOT take her!",1.5,5.0,,
"By no means was this an easy class, but being an upper level course a certain level of difficulty is to be expected. Attendance is mandatory, and essintial to make an A or B. Dr. Rouse is very nice and willing to help students, but students definitly have to earn their grade. I would not recommend this class for an elective.",3.5,3.0,,
"She shouldn't deduct points for attendance if she can't even be on time every day herself. I was passing her Identity class, but she took off so many attendance points that it ruined my grade. She is very inconsiderate of circumstances for missing class. Do not take her! Worst teacher!",1.0,5.0,,
"A complete delight as a person.  Unfortunately, can't say same for teaching ability.  She appears to have ADD & is incapable of following a thought thru.

She wrote the ""textbook""",1.5,3.0,,
Finally done with this class and I wouldn't recommend anyone taking her. It was a bad class. She never reviewed before exams and would go into these crazy lectures that didn't make sense. Good luck if you take her bc you will need it. This was not an easy class to take. It was not a good class to be in.,2.5,5.0,,
"There was a previous comment about this being an easy ""A"" class. That's CRAZY!! My entire life I've been an honor roll student and after taking this class, I'm no longer. Dr. Rouse makes this class more difficult then it should be. Why are they allowing her to continue to teach this class?!!",1.0,5.0,,
"She is a really BAD teacher. All her exams are basically THEORY (little problem solving). She has her own glossary w/definitions but when you take exams, she RE-WORDS entire definitions. It's INSANE. YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU TAKE HER. You can't miss more then 4 days from her class or you get a lot of points deducted.",1.0,5.0,,
"Dr. Rouse is a nice lady BUT she has no business teaching math. She gives boring lectures and when working problems on board, they're a mess.

They said if they couldn't understand her work, the average student would be very lost.",1.5,5.0,,
"Math is ""NOT"" an easy subject for me but if you're fortunate to have a good math teacher, you will do just fine. This is not the case with Dr. Rouse. She is very confusing.

Lectures are so dry and all he cares about is talking about the research he and his grad students do. I didn't learn a thing.

"For a university-level ""teacher"", he does NOT teach. Walks into classroom, projects worked out problems on the projector while he points with a laser, flies through examples in two minutes or less, and assigns homework in every class. NEVER works out problems or examples on the board. Don't expect much guidance when you approach him with questions.",1.5,5.0, Not Mandatory,
"He sets a pedestrian for you that you have to meet. His grading is tough. Hes a very nice guy. Ask for help and hell give it you.

"He makes his point clear from the start of the semester. If youre looking for an easy class, this is not it. You have to work really hard for your grade. He gives homework in every class, make sure you can do all of them by yourself and youll be fine in the exams. Just make sure you dont make errors in the exam because he grades very harshly.",2.5,4.0, Not Mandatory,
Dr. Wimberly sets his expectations from the beginning of the semester. You have to do the home work (WO the solution manual) to get anything out of it that will prepare you for the tests. I started the semester with poor test grades and had to work my butt off on the final to get a C in the class. Don't try to beat the system and do your own HW!!!,2.5,4.0, Mandatory,
"Must go to every class, he assigns homework every single time.  His teaching style is showing problems on slides and just going through them.  Don't take him if you cant teach yourself because that's what you must do basically.  He grades very tough a simple error costs alot.",2.0,4.0,,
"I don't think he is a bad professor at all. He is clear on his expectations, and the exams are not that hard. They are fair. It bothers me that when you ask something in class he doesn't answer the question, he doesn't even pay attention to what you said. He just reads the problem again. So basically you have to teach yourself the material.",2.0,3.0, Mandatory,
"My only issue with him is that he assigns homework EVERY day. Therefore although attendance is not technically mandatory, you must submit it each day in class. He is not the best teacher, however the subject matter was easy and majority of students already understood it prior to the class. If you have limited understanding of physics, dont pick him",3.5,2.0,,
"I read all the reviews before I signed up for the class. Now I don't see what all the fuss is about. I earned a B in the class. Looking back, if I completed the course again I would make an A--no problem. I made a lot of mistakes. Yes, they hurt, but none of us tolerate ""mistakes"" from anyone else in the real world.  I'd recommend him. Nice guy too",4.5,3.0,,
"Made B. All of the past reviews are correct, he lectures off of pdf slides. So basically class attendance isn't mandatory since there's no class interaction; I stayed though. Homework should be fairly easy, but once the test comes he lets you use the book, so be sure to write past test problems in it; they'll be sure to come up. Nice guy though.",3.0,4.0,,
Wimberly is very stern and harsh when it comes to grading. Test are generally not difficult but sign errors and little mistakes cost you a letter grade. However I put his helpfulness at max because he took pity on my soul and was one of the few he curved. So I'd recommend going to his office and generally saying Hi and Bye after every class.,3.0,5.0,,
"If you ask him a question in class, he will formulate a question in his head that sounds like yours, then answer something completely unrelated.

He just stands up at the front of the class and talks through examples or homework. He expects you to understand the concepts by just being given the formulas and seeing examples. He grades the tests pretty hard and you have to earn the partial credit he gives. If you want to succeed in this class then you are going to have to put the time in.,2.0,4.0,,

As long as you go to class, read all the articles in the textbook she makes for you, and complete all the papers well (3 small, 1 8-10 page), you should get an A. The papers she assigns are opinion based with the choice of format.",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Solid prof. Very easy to talk to. No book, but you have to buy a reading packet thing from her. Only $25. Almost entirely discussion based with quizes on the readings most classes. A couple papers due through the semester. Have to do a presentation or poster. Some really awkward material to discuss sometimes. Hardly any men take the class.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Cindy is a well rounded human, and this makes her a fantastic professor. She gives a lot of quizzes but if you read the text and look over the questions before class they are super easy.

"You will not regret taking any of Cindy's classes. She is hands-down the best prof I have had on this campus, and has changed my life inside the classroom and out.

"The BEST professor on campus, hands down. She is challenging and expects a lot out of her students, but she is worth taking and she will change your life.

Take her for any class you can, you will not regret it at all.",5.0,3.0,,

"The BEST (female) professor I've EVER had. I'm going into my senior year at SRU and I've NEVER read ANY textbook as fervently and frequently as when I read in her class.

"Dr. Zirpoli's class is hard, but not impossible to do well in. Watch her videos, it's the only way to understand what's going on.

She curved the final too which was nice. ",2.0,4.0, Not Mandatory,
"Dr. Zirpoli is a very nice person but as soon as she goes into teaching mode, it's game over. Lectures are not really helpful as she just reads from the slides.

"One of the worst professors I ever had at SRU.doesn't explain things very well and goes very fast through lectures with little time to ask questions.

"This is a challenging class for anyone especially if you don't already have a good foundation for the subject. Teaches extremely fast and in a monotone voice.

"Print the notes and follow along. Do not expect an easy A. Do the homework and make sure you understand it because the quizzes and exams are similar, there are no tricks.

Was impossible to pass this class. She straight up tells you she expects you to spend 3-5 hours on each homework assignment (that's only 8% of your grade) and is rude and gives dirty looks when she has to re explain something that you don't understand. I studied so hard but her I never got above a 69 on her exams. Try another professor.,2.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"Dr. Zirpoli is tough don't get me wrong, but I liked her class. She makes you work for it with weekly homework and quizzes on every chapter.

If you are immature and won't study you will not pass her class. She is extremely fair and gives the grade you deserve.

I would never take this professor again.",1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
I did not pass this class. I passed Chemistry 2 Lab with an A as well as Chem 1 lecture and lab. I went to her office hours several times and she was not helpful at all.

I worked my butt off to try to pass this class and didn't.,1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Dr. Zirpoli has a bad reputation on campus for being the hardest Chemistry I professor. Although this is true, if you put in the work, you will get the grade you deserve.

Take this class very seriously.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Zirpoli teaches a hard subject, so obviously a lot of people will complain about not doing well.

Don't bothering taking this class unless you WANT to fail. You will not learn anything with this teacher.,1.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Impossible to do well. Reads over each slide in about 45 seconds. You are better off trying to learn on your own. Do not take this unless you're a chemistry major.

Not clear in explaining things whatsoever. Thank god I took AP chem in high school last year or there is no way I would pass this class!

I had her for Intro to ES and it was a fairly decent class. She is very entertaining and that makes class fun.

Lectures are important. Readings are heavy but not so much important. Make sure you generalize the slides and lectures so that you both have an general impression on historical events and details. Kavanagh's grading is test-heavy but review and you'll be good. ,3.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"The worst professor I have ever had. He took over teaching Latin during winter term and I saw my 80 drop to a 50. He had two 40% midterms and a 20% final, what? He provided no insight on what to expect for these tests and provided no feedback after they were completed. Unaccommodating and inaccessible. I'll be avoiding him the rest of my degree",1.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
"Literally the worst professor I ever had. I was going through a difficult time personally and asked for an extension on a specific assignment.

"Dr. Kavanagh has a soft voice so sit in the front so you can hear and don't fall asleep. Tests based on lecture content and his slides don't contain info so make sure you take notes.

"Coming from a science background, I found this course to be somewhat difficult. The professor requires that you know the exact dates and spellings of names and terms to just about everything for the midterms and final (which are all fill in the blank). You CANNOT afford to miss ANY lecture because he only posts slides with pictures and names/dates",3.0,4.0, Mandatory, No

Lectures are awesome and hilarious at times! The course material is interesting. Its a lot of rote memorization but if you attend all lectures you know what to expect for the midterm and finals.

"Great professor if you're NOT seeking a bird course.  Many comments will be skewed by kids seeking a bird courses.  Attendance, paying attention is important.

He's harsh but fair, and brilliant.",4.5,3.0,,
"Unlike previous reviewers, I never witnessed him be anything but nice, but he is indeed a good ol' boy and therefore expects good attendance, punctuality, and no texting! Disliked the class.

Hardest marker I've ever had.  I will never again take one of his courses nor recommend one to a friend.  Fair tests but marks essays to a ridiculous standard.  Does NOT reply to e-mails.  Does not accept criticism and will never admit he's wrong even if he is.,2.5,5.0,,
He's a stickler (and fairly so) about being on time.  His tests are fair and if you attend lectures and do you're readings - you'll do well.  His expectations for essays are clear (primary sources) and he'll give you hints of resources to use on those papers.,5.0,4.0,,
"Very knowledgable - knows his primary sources.  He challenges you.  Some students may be upset because they expect him to help write their essays.  Not his job, but he will help you in directing you to find areas to find your research.  He's one of the main reasons I took so many classes in classics.",4.5,4.0,,

"I loved classics before I had this professor. I usually never miss class, but I always found an excuse not to attend hers. One of the reasons why I left the department.

"I thought he was a solid teacher. The class content is a little more challenging than most, but Dr. Crawford made the material easy to understand by going through plenty of practice problems. He was always willing to meet me outside of class, and was always super nice.",4.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Dr. Crawford is a sweet man who is a great teacher. Does lots practice problems in class and provides you with more challenging ones on the course website that make the tests seem fairly easy if you do them. Go to him with questions and he is very good at dumbing things down at first so you can learn it. Gives a little extra credit which can help,4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"This class is pretty challenging and he did his best to teach it. He held review sessions before all of the exams and was super willing to meet during office hours, but his exams were extremely difficult. The questions are not multiple choice and are all short answer, fill in the blank, etc. When studying, put emphasis on math problems!!!",3.0,5.0, Mandatory, Yes
Great professor. I learned a ton from him. He is very funny in lecture (not required but definitely need to go to pass) and he really cares about his students. His tests are very difficult-if you have previous tests they are very good to study from. Make friends to study with and you'll be fine. Would recommend Dr. Crawford any day. He's the best.,4.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Crawford has got to be one of my favorite professors. I have taken him twice now, and I still think he is as just as wonderful the second time around. The tests and homework are of course hard, so I would recommend putting a lot of time and effort into this class. Even though the material is tough, you can get through it. I enjoyed this class.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Crawford is a wonderful professor. He acts like he genuinly cares about his students. As nice as he was, that does not make the material any easier. There are a lot of practice problems that you should do to make sure you follow the information. The tests were pretty hard too and grades averaged to be in the 60's. Just make sure you study.",4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Crawford gives lots of problem sets and reading assignments, and his exams are difficult. I had to put in 6-8 hours per week outside of lecture for his class. But if you study like he expects you to do, you should get at least a C in his class. He is also willing to help if you have questions. So go to his office hours.",4.5,4.0, Not Mandatory,
Dr. Crawford is a good teacher and the only reason I got a B was my own fault. He goes over tons of practice problems during class so you don't want to miss. He is really nice and will answer all the questions you have. He also gives real life examples to help you grasp the concept better.,4.5,3.0, Not Mandatory,
"Chemistry is hard and Dr. Crawford does NOT know how to dumb it down but he is much better one-on-one. If you utilize his office hours you will do better in the class. He sometimes switches from exams with all multiple choice to some with partial credit. If you actually work hard and try to grasp the material, you can get a decent grade.",3.0,4.0,,
Seems like an OK guy but makes a 2nd semester chem class  much harder than it should be. Class average on our tests was in the mid 60s.  Tests and quizzes felt like they were intentionally designed to confuse and trip you up instead of actually testing your knowledge of the material.  Would probably be a decent course with a different professor.,2.0,5.0, Mandatory,
Chemistry isn't a strong point for me so this could be biased. The tests are very hard. If you read the book it helps a lot. Do the homework and the extra credit when its offered. Chemistry is hard for most people in general but if you go to his office hours and email him it makes all the difference.,2.5,5.0, Mandatory,
"Well, you have to study a lot, otherwise you will loose the track, there were 4 test and final test. Final test is comprehensive, which is harder one as it is marked from 150.

If you can do well on those, you shouldn't have too many problems.",3.0,4.0,,
"Dr. Crawford makes this class harder than it needs to be. While I ended up with a B in the course, I certainly had to work hard to earn it. Reading the text everyday, attending every lecture, and doing tons of practice problems help. His little quizzes aren't many questions so they can KILL your grade quickly.",2.5,4.0, Mandatory,
"He knows what he is talking about, but I didn't learn any thing from him. To make sure I could pass the class I had a tutor,read the book, look at other professors on YouTube , and I went to lecture every class! He makes this class a lot harder then it should be.",2.5,4.0, Mandatory,

Make sure you stay during the review sessions.",5.0,3.0,, Yes
I had a hard time in his lab cause I couldn't hear him at all in the back & since the physics dept doesn't follow the exact procedure on the manual you're usually trying to figure out how to do the lab yourself since you couldn't hear him.

I had Straker last year for ENGL 200 and only now (after the first week of school) have I really come to appreciate him. He is the best English lecturer at Queen's by far.

He is very accommodating and understanding... a great person and prof through and through.,5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"I made sure to get in to Straker's English 100  class as a former student of his raved about him. He absolutely lived up to my expectations.

Overall, it was a fantastic course.",5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes

I would definitely recommend taking any of her courses!",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Prof Schlick taught a total of 4 classes this semester.  She wasted time with individual presentations AND group presentations.  Her required reading was extensive and uninteresting.

"Although Dr. Foley was very kind and told great stories about her own excavations I found this course to be relatively boring. focus on only a few sites in Greece was slightly disappointing, and her lectures put me to sleep.    I would only take this course if you are seriously considering a career in archaeology",3.0,2.0, Not Mandatory,
Anne Foley is definitely one of my favourite professors. Lectures were enjoyable since she's passionate about Archaeology and tells many personal stories. Course only consisted of two slide tests and one small easy essay. No exam in fall 2015 because she didn't feel like giving one. Textbook was unnecessary because lectures were very clear.,5.0,1.0, Mandatory,
Great prof. she is very interested in what she teaches and always willing to help students or talk with you about anything you don't understand.

Marks very quickly and its easy to get a good grade if you go to class.,5.0,2.0,,
"Roman history, what can I say? She goes a bit fast at times but it is very easy to follow. You must attend class and take notes, she tests you on things she says and you won't find it in the book (don't buy it, its useless).

Both text and lectures are important, so dont be lazy, He always kept things interesting, (i.e. attacking a Bobo doll to demonstrate ""aggression"").

"I had a three hour lecture from 6:30 - 9:30, his was able to keep the class somewhat interesting.

Tests are multiple choice-but don't let that fool you, they are quite difficult. Switch out.",1.0,4.0, Mandatory,

His lectures aren't bad he's very engaging The only thing about this prof was his test were quite difficult they are all multiple choice and they are mostly application multiple choice.

Really tough unit tests,4.0,4.0,,
Tells you the tests and exams are based on lecture and textbook material but you could do well in the course with just studying off of his lecture notes.

"One of the most difficult 200 level psych courses at Waterloo if you have it with him as an instructor in-class.

"To whoever left the really good review about PSYCH 253, you must have taken it in class. This prof clearly does not care about you if you take his course online.

It's unfortunate that my only exposure to this prof has been in a 350 person class. The positives: he manages the stage well and has a good sense of humour.

I had to take the class but I couldn't have hoped for a better prof. He is humerous and did a great job with the material.

Really interesting content and well-made narrated slides. There is no essay in this class. The multiple-choice questions on the term tests are too detail-oriented (the same with many other PSYCH courses) but she is lenient when marking the short-answer questions. Can get up to 4 bonus marks for research experience credits (e.g. SONA).,5.0,4.0,, Yes
I don't mind her lectures with the exception of her retina-burning slides. However she will ask you to buy the newest version of the textbook over the old version stating that the old one has been 'revised twice' only for most of the content the same. The wording for her test is so confusing even if you study the topic to the best of your ability.,2.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, No

Not a good prof. Seems really bored by teaching and the material and it makes the lectures kinda boring. She tries to be nice but comes across as disingenuous. Her tests are vague and ambiguous so getting marks is more about guessing what she means than knowing the material. Not a deal breaker if the course is easy but not a first choice.,3.0,3.0,,

Never posts solutions to practice problems/tutorials and waits forever to upload solutions to tests.,1.0,5.0,, No
"Lectures are totally confusing. Even if you pay attention in class, you still won't understand the way he explains the concepts. Focus is too much on theoretical things. Examples on Algebraic proofs are not enough at all and expects so much of them on tests. His response to questions are even more confusing.",1.0,5.0,, No
Algebra is normally a challenging course but he tried to make it several times more difficult with heavy and confusing lectures. His tests are way too brutal and often cover things that are unrelated to lectures or textbook. His office hours sometimes end way too early and some people don't even have a chance of asking him.,1.0,5.0,, No
Challenging but extremely interesting! Gives a lot of motivation for why we study what we study instead of simply stating results with no commentary. Highly recommend!,5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
Very confusing lectures. Moves in a pace that's very difficult to keep up. Leaves too many things as an exercise without starting an example related to them. Lack of proof examples especially.

you are the best professor i have ever seen in my academic life,5.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

"I started this course having heard Siva was difficult. Fast forward to the end of the semester and I have been very satisfied with how he teaches, and his flexible/easy going attitude. His lectures mostly focus on theory, with examples in the tutorials. He is nice to students, very knowledgeable in geotechnical/foundation engineering.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Will give you a good foundation for knowledge as long as you go to class. He posts useful supplementary lecture notes which will also help you get a good footing.

"It's hard to say anything positive about Siva, except for his flawless attendance. My PA sessions were more useful to me.

HIS QUESTIONS APPEAR ON EXAMS.,4.0,1.0,,
He enjoys annoying students by making and complicated exams. Very boring classes. Notes very theoretical and not practical.,1.5,5.0,,

It's the best class!!,5.0,2.0,,
Some people obviously don't come to class or come to class late. Dr.Liston's strict with her policy on tardiness and rightly so. The lecture hall she teaches in isn't arranged well and it's very annoying if entire rows of people have to get up to accomodate a person who shows up 10 min late. Dr Liston simply speaks for the majority. V.good teacher!,5.0,2.0,,

I should state that I did not attend many classes, as they were at 8:30 on Mondays, but the classes I did attend I could tell she was passionate for what she taught.

Too many class minutes were wasted waiting for non-sequitorial comments to be spun out..and too many texts: why read 300 page novels to spend 1/2 a class ""discussing them""???

"I have Professor Quesada right now for Winter, and it is an amazing class. 12 journals about specific topics discussed with a midterm and final. She is so sweet and is there for her students to learn about Philosophy in the best way. She is the best and most kind professor ever, take her if she's offering the course! ",5.0,1.0,, Yes
This class was run smoothly by Professor Quesada. We watched movies and worked on journals that were due at the semester's end. The midterm and final focus on the films covered throughout the semester. She has videos on Youtube with her opinion regarding the subject of the film and really was passionate about philosophy. Take her! ,5.0,1.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

"There are a total of two assignments, the journal and the feature project. All work is due on the last day of class, which is something I wasn't too fond of. The problem with that was nobody exactly knew if they were doing the journals correctly throughout the class. She ended up grading very generously though. Overall a decent class.",4.0,2.0,, No
Professor Quesada is an expert in her field to say the least.

However, I recommend completing the assignments earlier and not waiting til last minute to be ahead",5.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Prof. Quesada is very nice! Took her during Fall 2020, Zoom meetings are recommended, but optional. Easy class. All the assignments (journals, essay) have to be submitted by the last day of class.

Do the work!",5.0,2.0, Mandatory, Yes

"I wish I would have read this first. Professor Amin is very passive-aggressive, unclear, and disorganized. With that being said, her standards feel very low and I have aced the class. It wasn't worth it to me. I feel like I taught myself everything, did not get feedback or any structure, and would have preferred someone else",2.0,2.0, Not Mandatory, No
Summary: Please don't take this class. Find another teacher �� Her grading was questionable. Her powerpoints and slides were worse than her grammar.

"she is an easy A, her tests are literally the study guide and you can use the study guide on the test. she is very nosy, she wants to be of every conversion going on in class. she will yell at you if you even peak at your phone.

"Terrible class. The tutors try their hardest to teach the class while Dr. Marentette does nothing; however, they also struggle.

"I found Paula to be very rude when my group asked for help because we did not know what to do. She was ""hangry"" and took it out on us. She got mad at my group because their excel was not working. She also raised her voice because we were confused on something that she didn't even teach us.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"Professor Marentette is a nice person, just haven't learned anything from her yet. I have sympathy for the TA's who are in charge of the class, we have a full overview of the course on our class website to learn the material on our own. The material is all on our website posted properly, just more difficult to pick up a full semester worth of work.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"Don't even waste your time taking this class lol. Can't believe I wasted my tuition on this, I feel bad for everyone except the instructor. Prof Marentette asks us if we're happy. No, no we're not. I know other students have expressed their issues with this class but I don't think she cares.",1.0,5.0, Mandatory,
"This is the worst class I've ever taken. This professor hasn't taught anything AT ALL but expects us to complete difficult quizzes which make ZERO sense every week and is extremely rude whenever you ask her for clarification.

Horrible professor. His accent makes it difficult to understand and in a whole lecture he completes about 2 questions - that too with a galore of mistakes.

Pretty easy gen. ed. option (instead of western civ). you can skip lecture if you want but I understood the readings better if I went to class that week.

Don't be scared.",4.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
I would recommend finding a good group because it will make the class a lot easier and less time consuming. The professor will help you and I had all emails answered within hours.

This is by far the absolute worst teacher i have ever had so far. He made me feel stupid even when I got A's on the tests.

You do the math.,1.0,5.0,,
"He is without a doubt the most thorough, passionate Professor to date.  Sure he's strict but with good reason, with a foreign lang. you must be dedicated and he gets offended when someone wastes his time and refuses to put the time into the class.

Tutoring sessions are part of the class and help a lot if you attend!",4.5,3.0,,

This is one of the oldest and meanest teachers Macomb has to offer. He does not care about teaching you Italian. He is just collecting retirment fund and his paycheck.

there are times when all he dose is yell about people in his other classes are asking him for help.He spends the study sessons to yell at my class saying things like we are stupid because we dont understand. if you dont like being treated like a dog dont take his class. find someone else so you dont waits your money and GPA adv.

The class was definitely worth it!",3.5,1.0,,

People in my class didn't seem to care about the course at all and it is sad, but Mr. Barrons lays everything out for you... if you care and take him seriously like I did, you can do good in his class. If you can't stay off your phone (even during breaks) do not take him. Master the outline!!!!!!!",5.0,3.0,,

If anyone dislikes him, it's because they did not study!!",4.5,2.0, Mandatory,
"Best professor I have had thus far. This course was very insightful, and highlighted the production and process of film making.

All you needed was a 75 cent outline, that was used all the time.",5.0,1.0, Mandatory,

"I'm shocked that MCC has kept this ""professor"" around this long. He needs to go NOW. I was so apalled by the way he sexually harassed every one of the attractive females in the class. I didn't pay MCC my hard earned money to listen to a ""professor"" flirting with my fellow classmates. I was really excited about this class but he made it unbearable.",1.5,4.0,,
"The book is a 75 cent outline.  You use it almost every class, which is more than I can say for most of my classes.  Professor Barrons tries to keep things light hearted and funny, which helps with the tedium of a 3 hour class.  Everything on the exam is in the outline, and you do a 5 page paper.  I really did enjoy the class.",5.0,1.0,,
"This isn't at all an ""artistic"" approach to films, he does a good job of what he does teach you(which is a broad overview of how the film industry works) but overall, this was the weakest class I've had with Professor Barrons, my suggestion, skip this and take Studies in Film either Vietnam or Science Fiction with him.",2.5,3.0,,

"""Film as Art"" does not once take an artistic view at film. All you learn is the technical aspects that go into making a film. CONS: Uses VHS tapes from the 80's to teach, biased grading system (Credit+, Credit, and Credit-), Final is 100 fill in the blank questions, only allowed one absence. PROS: Looks like col. Sanders, get to watch movies.",3.5,3.0,,
LOVED taking Prof Barrons Film as Art Class.  AMAZING.  He had all of our names memorized the first day and there were lots of us!!!  I learned so much and Prof. Barron made me want to learn.

"the only thing you need for this class is a .75 cent outline and memorize the whole thing, that is pretty much your grade from your final. also, you write a final paper on all the films you watched, it's not a hard class at all. oh, and he makes it a point to know everyone's name on the first day of class... that's just skill",5.0,1.0,,

"I'm transferring to WSU to major in film. The class doesn't teach you a lot, but it's NOT hard. He's a bit ambiguous in terms of your grade, but just memorize that outline and you'll be fine.

"I still make fun of this guy's voice to this very day. He was not the best professor and I believe you should avoid him at all costs.

He likes to use the word ingits too. ha!",2.5,4.0,,

Worst teacher I have had at SDSU. I am an A student and struggled to pass this class. His tests are set up for you to fail and it is obvious he doesn't care about his students.

He teaches from the book and is an alright professor.",4.0,3.0,,

Knows his material inside and out.  Can always count on his examples and anecdotes for a laugh.  I learned more from reviewing his slideshows individually since he does like to go quickly.

"Challenging course but Ronis is a good prof, probably one of the best prof I've had so far at McGill.

Worst. Does not know how to teach. Talks to himself through the whole class. He's a nice guy but the guy can't teach at all. All he does during class is write the derivatives and expect us to know everything he says and writes. Notes do not help at all. HARD cours,1.0,5.0,,

"Durst was the worst professor I had during my 8 years in university. He was a poor lecturer and an even worse teacher, passing off any actual teaching to his TAs (who were also unavailable).

"Decent prof. He thinks he is right about everything, but he actually provided some incorrect definitions and examples (i.e. Lipinski rules). The lecture slides were very disorganized. He is not very approachable. However, he is an engaging lecturer and the lectures were not boring; he did manage to convey most of the material well.",3.0,2.0,,
Great prof...possibly the best one I have had yet!!! He is really cute and very understanding. He may not be able to work a computer but honestly...that's not what an organic chemist has to do!

"He's really good, can be a tad redundant at times but he really teaches the class well. I love his anectodes!",4.5,2.0,,
Spec was one of my easiest and most fun class. This guy will dumb it down so much that you are really wondering whether this is an actual university course and his work exercise book is the best help ever and he will tell you do all of them if you want to get a good grade. The grades are proportional to the amount of time you put in the subject.,5.0,1.0,,
"Dr. Durst is a professor with a clear understanding of organic chemistry and even better clearer intentions for students: He wants you to do well. that being said, he respects intelligence and aims to challenge individuals taking his courses.

Vederas is amazing and extremely passionate about ochem. Went into this class terrified and left with chem261 being my favourite class ever taken.

Finals/midterms formatted exactly like practice.100p recommend. ,5.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Organic chemistry is a jump for general chemistry. In Chem 10X you are used to your profs almost babying you and helping you out, and breaking each concept down. Chem 261 is not like that, however the way Vederas explains concepts makes sense once you review. At times, he may do extremely complicated steps that don't end up being on the exam. ",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Vederas is in my opinion underrated. He does not beat around the bush with concepts and gives good and clear feedback in office hours. He sticks to the traditional note-taking strategy of writing on a whiteboard while still making notes accessible outside of class. Ultimately, he is a humorous, passionate, and respectable professor.",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"He is OK, as far as organic chemistry professors go. His midterms and finals are a lot like the ones he has online, however, his lecture style is archeal and he only gives shallow explanations and expects students to fill in the gaps themselves. If you have to take organic chemistry, he is the best in the department, but still not great.",2.0,3.0, Not Mandatory,
"He is great person, but his lectures do not make sense. You are given question periods a lot, but good luck unwinding the 100 reactions he uses in a sequence to explain 100 different concepts.

"Chem isn't my thing so I was terrified of Ochem due to all the bad experiences other people had but honestly this was my favourite chem class I've ever taken due to the professor. He was clear, genuine, passionate and had so many out of lecture resources like small videos on the lecture content to help us understand. 100% recommend this prof",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"He seems to teach the class a little bit differently than most other profs at uofa. He gives no practice questions and the textbook ones assigned don't really apply. His tests however, are always similar to his practice tests and pretty specific to what you do in class so it's possible to do quite well. He's entertaining but it is a hard class.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Highlight of this class is his lectures! Interesting and very engaging. His notes are good, but I definitely recommend attending class. Practice questions are all out of the textbook. His exams are difficult but very similar to samples.",5.0,3.0, Not Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Vederas is honestly one of the best professors I have ever had. Last term I dropped out of chem 261 by week 2 because I could not learn from a different professor. Vederas made this class interesting, easy to digest, and his exams were fair based on the questions he asked. The practice midterms were very representative, but no part marks.",4.0,4.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Take CHEM 261 with Vederas if youre someone who prefers single midterms, and a final as opposed to heavier work. Overall, this professor will prepare you for CHEM 263 because he teaches into content from that class. Vederass enthusiasm is unmatched, and he truly believes that all of his students are capable of succeeding. TAs are brutal though.",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
careless. unreasonable. cant teach. check check check. all of the above. so disappointing. online delivery was useless and notes are okish. exams unfair and you don't know what to expect because practice final and midterm were in different formats. he asks how to fix the course and then doesn't even listen to feedback. lol why are you asking then!?,1.0,5.0, Mandatory, No
"He will test you well and you can't get away with memorization but he is a VERY fair prof. His notes are very step by step and systematic which is what you need for OCHEM. He is a G, highly recommend him. Also, he scares you when he tells you past curve cutoffs (maybe to make you work harder) so don't be scared of that just work your best!",4.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Dr. Vederas is a gem! He was very well prepared for the transition and can tell he is very passionate about the course and his jokes and applications of the material put a smile on my face. Straightforward about what you need to know, exams do require you understand rather than memorize but its really fair!! Do take him he makes organic chem fun!",5.0,4.0,, Yes
"I took 264 with him. His teaching and notes is very not very detailed and are very generalized. Your mark is based on participation, midterm, and a final so not much opportunity to improve your marks. Exams are difficult. Online teaching was done poorly.",2.0,5.0, Not Mandatory, No
"Vederas is an amazing and hilarious guy, but not an amazing prof. The final was worth nearly 40% of our grade and only had 25 questions (all mc or t/f). I'm not sure if being online made the course that much harder for him to teach, but I don't think he adjusted well enough to teaching online properly. I definitely feel like my education suffered.",2.0,5.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Not sure if things were different with classes being online, but I felt that the assessments were not an accurate measure of what was taught in class. For example, the final had only 25 multiple choice questions and most of them were on pre-midterm content which was frustrating as I had put many hours into studying post-midterm content.",2.0,4.0, Mandatory, No
the final exam was nothing like the practice midterms that he assigned. the mechanism questions were really hard and confusing. the midterm was okay for me but the final was worth 40% and i am sure i didnt do too good on it even though i studied really hard.,1.0,5.0,, No
"I really enjoyed John as my prof. The problem most people probably have with him is that he is test heavy; besides lab, your grade is made up of a midterm and a final. I wouldn't say these were over hard- it's a hard topic, but he's fair with level of difficulty. Just pay attention and put the time in!",5.0,3.0, Mandatory, Yes
"Videos and notes are great, but the zoom lectures are not very helpful. I recommend students to spend more time studying instead of attending the zoom q&a. The textbook questions that he assigned are also quite hard and beyond the scope of this course. So basically just use his notes and do the practice tests and understanding everything in them.",2.0,5.0,, No
midterm made me cry :( Will update later if difficulty/structure of the course and exams changes.

"This professor is clearly passionate about what he does and is good at explaining relatively basic concepts. I took this class solely as a GPA booster.

"Extremely chill class, is very very VERY axiomatic with how he explains things so if you're new to proofs you will be okay, is extremely nice in office hours and in lecture, and is an extremely organized lecture.

Attendance is essential.",5.0,3.0,,

"Tests are hard (options A-H), but provides you with previous tests so high grades should not be hard. His lectures are horrendously unfocused, which makes writing class notes v.difficult.

Miserably confusing tests and very hard marking.  Both laboratory work and tests are not organized at all.  Test questions are very ambiguous. Professor uses the same tricky questions every year.

I struggled in this class.",4.0,3.0,,
Knows his stuff really well but his lectures are just reading of his slides which is from the textbook which is also on myeconlab. Basically if you read the textbook you will do well.

Dr. Foxall has the amazing ability to simplify complex course material. Psychology is a challenging course just as university is hard in a general sense.

The only B I have received in the last two years of my undergrad. The gradings on the paper (worth more than the midterm) are a complete hit or miss (you either get an nice grad student grader or you don't).

I would definitely take a class with him again.",5.0,4.0, Not Mandatory, Yes

Terrible lectures: New stuff often conflicts with previous concepts. When he explains things it just gets more confusing. Tests aren't strongly associated with materials(solve them by luck).
